Compiling and installing ircu should be a fairly straightforward process,
if you have obtained this software as a (.tar.gz) package, please consider
using CVS (described below). Using CVS will make updating your installation
much easier. 

After obtaining the latest version of the ircu source code, change into the
source directory (ircu2.10), and run "./configure". To see the various ways
in which you can customize your installation, run "./configure --help".

The configure process will check your environment and prepare itself for
compiling the source code. If one or more of the prerequisites cannot be
found, configure will terminate with an error. You will need to resolve
this and run configure again.

If configure runs without error(s), you are ready to compile. To compile ircu,
run "make". Please use GNU make and gcc. If the source code does not compile,
make sure your environment is setup correctly. If you are convinced the source
of the failure is ircu, gather all relevant information about your system such
as the Architecture, OS version, the configure statement you used, etc. and
contact coder-com@undernet.org.

Once ircu is compiled, install it by running "make install".

Next, you will have to configure your IRC server by setting up your ircd.conf
file. Use the included doc/ircd.conf.sample as a starting point. 
Setting up ircd.conf can be a bit tricky, so if this is your first time doing
it, begin with a bare-bones configuration and extend it as you go.

If you are upgrading from ircu2.10.10, use the tools/transition script to
convert your existing configuration file(s).

Good Luck!

RETRIEVING IRCU VIA CVS

The recommended way to get the ircu package now is to use CVS.  CVS makes
upgrades a lot less painful and lets you get the latest package.

The first thing you need to do is login to the cvs server:
# cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@coder-com.undernet.org:/home/coder-com/cvs login

(we recommend that you cut and paste the above line to use it :)
When it prompts you for a password enter "anoncvs".

To check out the the last stable version of ircu, use:
# cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@coder-com.undernet.org:/home/coder-com/cvs checkout -P ircu2.10

To update your source tree to the latest version, run "cvs update -dP" from within the
ircu2.10 directory. For more information, see http://coder-com.undernet.org.
