This is the UnderNet IRC daemon.

The installation of the IRC daemon (ircd) exists of the following steps:

1) Untar the package.
2) cd into the base directory.
3 )`./configure'
4) `make config'
5) `make'
6) `make install'

1) Untar the package
====================

The name of the package is something like `ircu2.x.y.z.tgz', where
"x.y.z" is the current release (at the time of writing we have
ircu2.10.00.beta3.tgz).

You need `gzip', the GNU unzip command, to uncompress this package.
You can download this from every GNU ftp site for almost any Operating system.

If you have GNU tar, type:

tar xzf ircu2.x.y.z.tgz

where "ircu2.x.y.z.tgz" is the name of the package.

If your tar doesn't support the 'z' flag, you can type alternatively:

gzip -dc ircu2.x.y.z.tgz | tar xf -

Both methods result in a directory "ircu2.x.y.z" in your current directory.

2) cd into the base directory
=============================

Make this directory your current directory by typing:

cd ircu2.x.y.z

where "ircu2.x.y.z" is the name of the unpacked directory.

3) `./configure'
==============

This will generate 'config/setup.h', your Operating System dependend
configuration.

4) `make config'
================

This will (re)generate the include/config.h file.  You can run this
as often as you like and it will use your last values as defaults.
At every question you can type a '?' (followed by a return) to get
extensive help, or a 'c' to continue using your old values by default
(quickly finishing the script).

5) `make'
=========

Type:

make

in the base directory.  It should compile without errors or warnings.
Please mail any problem to the maintainer, but only AFTER you made sure
you did everything the right way.  If you want your Operating System
to be supported in future releases, you best make a patch that
actually fixes the problem.

6) `make install'
=================

This should install the ircd and the man page. Please recheck the
permissions of the binary.
You need to create some of the logfiles that you have chosen by hand
(for instance with 'touch') before the ircd starts writing to them.
Of course, you need a syntactically correct ircd.conf in DPATH.  See the
docs for some info on this.  Also create an ircd.motd with the text of
your MOTD.  And finally create a remote.motd with three lines of text
as the remote MOTD.  Again, all of these files should be readable by the
ircd, and the logfiles should be writeable.


In case of problems
===================

If you have problems configuring the server you might consider installing
GNU make in your PATH.  In some cases a brain-dead /bin/sh is causing the
problem, in which case I suggest to install 'bash' and use that (as sh -> bash).
Finally, any other compile problem should be solved when you install gcc.

If you have problems with starting the ircd, run 'make config' again
and define DEBUGMODE.  Recompile the ircd, and run it by hand as:

ircd -t -x9

This will write debug output to your screen, probably showing why it
doesn't start.

Don't use a server with DEBUGMODE defined on a production net.
