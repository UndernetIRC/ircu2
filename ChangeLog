2002-12-28  Kevin L Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/m_create.c (ms_create): we must pass in a flag, not a
	boolean 1 or 0!  Good spotting splidge...

2002-12-18  Kevin L Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_stats.c (stats_init): er, should have started at 0--not
	that we'll ever see a /stats '\0', but just for completeness' sake
	:)

	* ircd/s_user.c (hide_hostmask): only send the reply if the user's
	on my server

2002-12-17 hikari <shadow@undernet.org>
	* ircd/s_err.c: added RPL_HOSTHIDDEN reply text

	* ircd/s_user.c: send a confirmation of mode +x using reply numeric
	RPL_HOSTHIDDEN

	* include/numeric.h: addition of RPL_HOSTHIDDEN as 396

2002-12-13 Zoot <zoot@gamesnet.net>
	* ircd/m_whois.c (do_whois): use IsChanOp and HasVoice macros
	instead of is_chan_op() and has_voice since we already have
	membership links.

2002-12-15 Isomer <Isomer@undernet.org>
	* include/patchlevel.h: Release this sucker!

2002-12-11 Isomer <Isomer@undernet.org>
	* tools/linesync.sh: Update

	* include/ircd_alloc.h: Disable the frobulator by default, it has
	alignment issues on non intel.

2002-12-10 Isomer <Isomer@undernet.org>
	* RELEASE.NOTES: Note problem we've seen on larger FBSD boxen

	* ircd/s_user.c: Don't set +x on connect, since other servers ignore
	-x, and possible desyncs with -x.

2002-12-03 hikari <shadow@undernet.org>

        * ircd/Makefile.in: fluff to link ircd/m_wallvoices.c

        * ircd/parse.c: addition of wallvoices parsers

        * ircd/send.c: addition of a check for SKIP_NONVOICES which causes
        a check for !IsChanOp() && !HasVoice()

        * ircd/m_wallvoices.c: new m_wallvoices() and ms_wallvoices()
        functions message is sent as "#channel :+ foo"

        * ircd/m_wallchops.c: modifed so the format is now "#channel :@
        * foo"
        to match the WALLVOICES form...after a little "discussion" on the
        mater

        * include/send.h: addition of defintion for SKIP_NONVOICES

        * include/msg.h: command defines

        * include/handlers.h: function declarations

2002-11-30  <splidge@quakenet.org>
	* ircd/ircd_alloc.h: Patched frobulator bug overwriting too much

2002-11-26  Perry Lorier  <isomer@undernet.org>
	* ircd/m_join.c: Update messages

2002-11-27  Andrew Miller <a1kmm@mware.virtualave.net>
	* ircd/channel.c: Don't access memory after it is freed.
	* include/patchlevel.h: Bump patchlevel again to stop confusion.
	
2002-11-26  Perry Lorier  <isomer@undernet.org>
	* include/patchlevel.h: Update version string

2002-11-26  Perry Lorier  <isomer@undernet.org>
	* ircd/m_kill.c: Overzealous assert(3).

2002-11-25  Perry Lorier  <isomer@undernet.org>
	* include/ircd_alloc.h, ircd_alloc.c: Readded the side effect of
	MyFree() setting the pointer to NULL.

2002-11-24  Kevin L Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/m_settime.c: rewrite m[so]_settime().  Critical changes
	are: servers may also send SETTIMEs to specific remote servers
	(but are not required to); if we handle such a SETTIME that is
	*not* for us, not only forward it, but if it's more than 30
	seconds off in either direction (automatically corrected by code
	before this), bounce a corrective SETTIME to our previous hop
	(only if we're RELIABLE_CLOCK, of course); opers may now specify a
	time of "0" to SETTIME to have the server fill it
	in--RELIABLE_CLOCK servers will always fill in their own time

	* ircd/m_create.c (ms_create): initialize the joinbufs just before
	the for loop; issue a SETTIME if the remote server is > 1 minute
	ahead, rather than squiting if it's > 5 minutes ahead

	* ircd/s_user.c (hunt_server_prio_cmd): comment out the assert--we
	now permit servers to send SETTIME to targeted servers

	* ircd/m_create.c (ms_create): exit the client's *server*, not the
	client--I was wondering why we weren't seeing any of these squits
	on the network!

2002-11-24  Andrew Miller <a1kmm@mware.virtualave.net>
	* include/ircd_alloc.h: Support FROBONMALLOC and FROBONFREE. Turned on
	now for debugging.
	
	* ircd/ircd_alloc.c (MyMalloc,MyRealloc,MyCalloc,MyFree): Made these
	functions work with frobbing.

2002-11-23  Kevin L Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/m_kick.c (ms_kick): if a kick comes from a user, it should
	*appear* to be from the user

	* ircd/s_bsd.c (deliver_it): this should have been a ClrFlag(),
	not a SetFlag()--caused crashes on /restart and probably other
	nastiness

	* ircd/client.c (client_set_privs): must count up through
	PRIV_LAST_PRIV rather than 0, since we *start* at zero

	* include/client.h: I was so inspired by the use of enum Flag by
	Entrope that I decided to use an enum for privileges as well

	* include/whocmds.h (SEE_LUSER): correct a bug in SEE_LUSER with
	regard to the PRIV_SHOW_INVIS / PRIV_SHOW_ALL_INVIS privileges

	* ircd/client.c: use enum Priv for privilage table

	* include/client.h: remove a comma from the end of the enumerator
	list--resulted in a gcc warning.

2002-11-04  Entrope  <entrope@gamesnet.net>

	* include/client.h: Convert cli_flags into a struct rather
        than a plain integer.  Add and update helper macros to match.

	changes (see below).

	(send_umode_out): Update arguments and send_umode() call to
        match new send_umode() arguments.
	(hide_hostmask): Change meaning of "flag" argument to be flag
        number rather than bitmask.  Update to match new FLAG_* values
        and access macros.
	(set_user_mode): Change "setflags" to struct Flags type, and
        use new FLAG_* values and access macros.  Use new arguments
        for send_umode_out().
	(umode_str): Update to match new FLAG_* values and access
        macros.  Update test for global modes.

	(send_umode): Change "old" argument to struct Flags* type and

        whether to send each mode.

2002-11-23  Kevin L Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/m_join.c (m_join): reset control character sentinel;
	otherwise, all channels after the first control-charactered
	channel get rejected as well

	* ircd/m_create.c (ms_create): add missing )

	* ircd/m_account.c: include string.h to stomp a "implicit
	declaration of strlen" warning from gcc

2002-11-20  Aaron Catella <aaroncatella@yahoo.com>

	* include/channel.h, ircd/channel.c, ircd/gline.c, m_clearmode.c,
	  m_create.c, m_invite.c, m_join.c, m_kick.c, m_mode.c, m_topic.c:

2002-11-24 Andrew Miller <a1kmm@mware.virtualave.net>
	* ircd/m_server.c: Fixed the H: line hostname checking.
	* docs/example.conf: Documented the max-hops feature.
	
2002-11-23  Perry Lorier <isomer@undernet.org>
	* ircd/m_nick.c: ms_nick had mysteriously gained a "return" in the
	middle of it.  This meant when two people had the same TS on a nick
	collide it was only killing one of them.  Thus we have phantom clients
	on the network, which desync channels and cause protocol violations...

2002-11-23  Perry Lorier <isomer@undernet.org>
	* ircd/m_nick.c: Minor cleanups and fixing some stuff I accidently
	commited before

	complete /stats k reply.  -- Spike
	
2002-10-30  Alex Badea  <vampire@p16.pub.ro>

	* ircd/m_whois.c (do_whois): reply real host to the user himself,
	in addition to opers

2002-10-23  Kevin L Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* doc/readme.features: fix documentation--HIS_REMOTE is an integer
	defaulting to 1, not a boolean defaulting to TRUE

	* doc/ircd.conf.sample: fix documentation--HIS_REMOTE is an
	integer defaulting to 1, not a boolean defaulting to TRUE; also
	comment out the default F-lines, since you only need an F-line if
	you want a non-default setting for a feature

	* doc/example.conf: fix documentation--HIS_REMOTE is an integer
	defaulting to 1, not a boolean defaulting to TRUE

2002-10-21  Alex Badea  <vampire@p16.pub.ro>

	the HOST_HIDING default to match the code

	* doc/ircd.conf.sample: default value for FEAT_AUTOHIDE

	* ircd/channel.c (mode_parse_key): correct an off-by-one error
	that failed to truncate passed-in keys correctly--this caused a
	presentation error that made the client think the key was one
	character longer than it actually was

	* ircd/channel.c (mode_process_bans): correct an off-by-one error
	that allowed only 29 (44) bans to be set instead of the full 30
	(45)

2002-10-19  Perry Lorier <isomer@undernet.org>

	* doc/example.conf: Changed defaults for host hiding and maxbans.

	* ircd/ircd_features.c: Changed defaults for host hiding and maxbans.

	* ircd/m_kick: Fixed braino.
	
2002-10-17  Perry Lorier <isomer@undernet.org>
	
	* ircd/m_kick.c (ms_kick): Don't HACK(3) when a server kicks it's own
	users, opers get twitchy.  Hide the kickee's server.

2002-10-17  Perry Lorier <isomer@undernet.org>
	
	* ircd/m_away.c (m_away): Don't forward away messages if users are
	already away.  It sucks a lot of bandwidth.

2002-10-15  Tim Vogelsang <net@astrolink.org>

       * ircd/channel.c (is_banned): users that are using account and not

       ignore accounts that are too long and send a warning through wallops.
       Updated by Isomer to use protocol_violation.

	* ircd/s_conf.c (rehash): remove calls to verify_client_list()

	* ircd/m_who.c (m_who): remove calls to verify_client_list()

	* ircd/list.c: remove calls to verify_client_list(); keep
	verify_client_list() around just in case we ever need it again,
	but never compile it in

	* ircd/ircd_events.c (event_execute): remove calls to
	verify_client_list()

	* ircd/client.c (client_get_ping): remove calls to
	verify_client_list()

	* include/list.h (send_listinfo): remove temporary debugging
	function verify_client_list()

	* ircd/uping.c: don't die if the event type is ET_ERROR in socket
	callback functions

	* ircd/res.c (res_callback): don't die if the event type is
	ET_ERROR

	* ircd/listener.c (accept_connection): don't die if the event type
	is ET_ERROR

2002-01-09  Kevin L Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_user.c (set_nick_name): bracket call to
	add_client_to_list() with calls to verify_client_list()

	* include/patchlevel.h (PATCHLEVEL): bump patchlevel (again)

	* ircd/list.c (verify_client_list): add a probabilistic loop
	detector: for every client added, there is a 2% probability that
	it will be used to replace the value of sentinel; if at any time,
	sentinel is found again, we know we're in a loop

	* ircd/ircd_events.c (event_execute): add verify_client_list()
	calls wrapping event_execute; at the very least, I'll figure out
	what event the corruption occurred in

	* ircd/list.c: moved verify_client_list() to try to keep it from
	being inlined

	* ircd/Makefile.in (version.c): version.c wasn't dependant on
	version.h and patchlevel.h, like it was supposed to be

	* include/patchlevel.h (PATCHLEVEL): bump patchlevel

	* ircd/s_auth.c (destroy_auth_request): overload send_reports
	argument to also indicate whether or not to call
	release_auth_client() and thereby enter the client into the linked
	list

	* ircd/engine_devpoll.c (engine_loop): remove bogus assertion

	* include/patchlevel.h (PATCHLEVEL): bump patchlevel

	* ircd/list.c (free_client): verify that destroy_auth_request()
	didn't automagically re-add us to the list; we might have to think
	about this interaction more carefully, actually

	* ircd/s_auth.c (auth_kill_client): zero the auth pointer before
	calling free_client(); otherwise, free_client() will try to free
	the auth by calling destroy_auth_request(), which will call
	add_client_to_list()

	* ircd/s_misc.c (exit_one_client): liberally sprinkle calls to
	verify_client_list() around to catch any corruption that might
	occur here

	* ircd/s_conf.c (rehash): liberally sprinkle calls to
	verify_client_list() here, since this is about the only routine I
	can think of that could cause the "core on kill -HUP" bug

	* ircd/m_who.c: sprinkle calls to verify_client_list() around
	liberally, since we've seen crashes here; temporarily include the
	otherwise unneeded list.h header

	* ircd/list.c: sprinkle calls to verify_client_list() around quite
	liberally; add debugging asserts to list manipulation functions to
	catch strange settings for next and prev pointers; define
	verify_client_list(), which walks the client list and verifies
	that everything is as it's supposed to be

	* ircd/client.c: wrap client_get_ping with calls to
	verify_client_list() to see if that's where we're dying

	* include/patchlevel.h (PATCHLEVEL): bump to 03

	* include/list.h: declare verify_client_list() if DEBUGMODE
	enabled; otherwise, define it to be empty

2002-01-08  Kevin L Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/m_quit.c (m_quit): remove an unused variable

	* include/patchlevel.h (PATCHLEVEL): bump PATCHLEVEL to 2

	* ircd/s_user.c: when building the user mode to send to the user,
	don't include +r; add an extra set of parens to squelch a warning

	* ircd/m_quit.c (m_quit): use exit_client_msg()

	* include/patchlevel.h (PATCHLEVEL): bump patch level, so we can
	keep track of who's running what version

	* ircd/m_squit.c (ms_squit): remove debugging calls to
	protocol_violation()

	* Makefile.in: change MAKEFILES to IRCD_MAKEFILES to work around a
	new gmake "feature" (pull-up from trunk)

	* ircd/m_quit.c (m_quit): prefix user quits with "Quit:" (pull-up
	from trunk)

2002-01-07  Kevin L Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_user.c: add FLAGS_ACCOUNT, represented as 'r', to the
	list of user modes; process account name as part of user mode in
	NICK decoding (set_nick_name()); add account name to usermode when
	building the usermode to incorporate in outgoing NICK messages

	* ircd/s_err.c: add RPL_WHOISACCOUNT for reporting what account a
	user is logged in to

	* ircd/parse.c: define the new ACCOUNT command, usable only by
	servers and ignored by everything else

	* ircd/m_whois.c: report what account name is associated with a
	user, if any

	* ircd/m_account.c: implement the ACCOUNT command

	* ircd/Makefile.in: add m_account.c to the list of sources; ran
	make depend

	* include/struct.h: add an account field to struct User

	* include/numeric.h: add a reply, RPL_WHOISACCOUNT, for reporting
	what username a user is logged in under

	* include/msg.h: add ACCOUNT command and token (AC)

	* include/ircd_defs.h: define ACCOUNTLEN to be 12--this matches
	the maximum length of a username for X

	* include/handlers.h: add declaration for ms_account()

	* include/client.h: add FLAGS_ACCOUNT to flag when a user account
	name has been set; added FLAGS_ACCOUNT to SEND_UMODES; added
	IsAccount() and SetAccount() to manipulate the flag

	* ircd/m_squit.c (ms_squit): if we call FindNServer() on a server
	name like "Amsterdam2.NL.EU.undernet.org", we get the struct
	Client for the server with numeric "Am", which happens to be
	stockholm!  To fix this, we look up the full name *first*; if that
	doesn't get it, *then* we look up by numeric.

2001-11-22  Perry Lorier  <isomer@coders.net>
	* ircd/m_squit.c: Bug fix in squit

2001-11-03  Greg Sikorski <gte@atomicrevs.demon.co.uk>
	* ircd/parse.c, include/handlers.h: Give remote whois the correct
	handler.
	
2001-11-01  Kevin L Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/send.c: some minor white-space fiddling; recast selector
	test in sendwallto_group_butone() to remove a warning regarding
	putting & within parentheses

	* ircd/m_create.c (ms_create): use time_t instead of int as a
	declaration for rate

	* ircd/ircd_reply.c (protocol_violation): it's supposed to be
	WALL_DESYNCH, not CMD_DESYNCH, if I understand things right--no
	wonder we weren't seeing any protocol violations!

	* include/send.h: include time.h for time_t; move WALL_* closer to
	the function they're used in; some white-space fiddling; add
	declaration of sendto_opmask_butone_ratelimited()

	* ircd/m_squit.c (ms_squit): add protocol_violation() calls in the
	cases where we ignore a squit, so we aren't taken by surprise, at
	least...

	* ircd/m_create.c (ms_create): Display origin server, not origin
	user

	* ircd/m_create.c (ms_create): Fix "Timestamp drift" server notice

2001-10-31  Perry Lorier  <isomer@coders.net>
	* include/m_ping.c: Forward port ping bug

2001-10-31  Perry Lorier  <isomer@coders.net>
	* include/patchlevel.h: We're beta now

2001-10-31  Perry Lorier  <isomer@coders.net>
	* ircd/s_user.c: fixed hunt_server

2001-09-21  Perry Lorier  <isomer@coders.net>
	* ircd/send.c and various: replace sendcmdto_flag_butone with
	sendwallto_group_butone

2001-09-21  Vampire-  <unknown>
	* ircd/ircd_string.c: unique_name_vector round II.

2001-09-21  mbuna  <mbuna@undernet.org>
	* configure.in: Add support for darwin

2001-09-21  Perry Lorier  <isomer@coders.net>
	* ircd/s_user.c I'm stupid, s/acptr/from/, Hektik pointed it out

2001-09-20  Perry Lorier  <isomer@coders.net>

	* Pullups from 2.10.10.pl16
	* Added some warnings, and the concept of rate limited snotices

2001-08-31  Kevin L Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/channel.c: use "%u" to format limit arguments; use
	strtoul() to process limit arguments in a /mode command--note:
	most clients seem to truncate the integer, probably because
	they're using atoi, and perhaps signed ints

2001-08-17  Kevin L Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/numnicks.c: include stdlib.h for exit()

	* ircd/ircd_log.c: include stdlib.h for exit()

	* ircd/ircd_events.c: include stdlib.h for exit()

	* ircd/s_stats.c: remove description of /stats v, since it's gone

	* ircd/m_wallops.c (mo_wallops): add "*" to the beginning of
	/wallops to distinguish wallops from wallusers

	* ircd/m_error.c (mr_error): ignore ERROR from clients that aren't
	in the "handshake" or "connecting" states--I think the latter will
	never happen, but...

	* doc/Authors: apply delete's Authors patch

	* RELEASE.NOTES: rewrite RELEASE.NOTES, basing it a little on
	Braden's version

	* README: rewrite README

2001-07-31  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_serv.c (server_estab): remove unused variable split

	* ircd/parse.c: add mr_error to the parse table

	* ircd/m_error.c (mr_error): add mr_error() to handle ERRORs from
	unregistered connections--if IsUserPort() is true, the ERROR is
	ignored, otherwise, the message is saved

2001-07-28  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/m_kill.c (ms_kill): another minor typo *sigh*

	* ircd/s_user.c (send_supported): oops, minor typo...

	* ircd/s_user.c: implement send_supported() to send two ISUPPORT
	messages containing our feature buffers; make register_user() use
	send_supported()

	* ircd/s_misc.c (exit_client): make sure not to give away a remote
	server in the ERROR message sent to the client; if the killer is a
	server, we substitute our name in its place

	* ircd/m_version.c (m_version): use send_supported() to send the
	ISUPPORT values to the user

	* ircd/m_nick.c: shave nick collision kills here a bit, too, for
	the same reasons as for m_kill.c

	* ircd/m_kill.c: shave kills a bit so that the results look
	exactly the same no matter where you are; if we didn't do this, it
	would be possible to map the network by looking at the differences
	between kills originating under various circumstances

	* include/supported.h: split the features into two, so as to not
	bust the parameter count when sending the features list

	* include/s_user.h: declare new send_supported() function to send
	the ISUPPORT information

2001-07-27  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_bsd.c: disable IP (*not* TCP) options to prevent
	source-routed spoofing attacks; this is only available under
	u2.10.11, so don't even bother, since no one but testers are using
	the source base

2001-07-25  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* include/ircd_policy.h: enable HEAD_IN_SAND_REMOTE by default

	* ircd/s_err.c: put in a . for reporting link version on /trace,
	to match what /version does

2001-07-21  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_misc.c (exit_client): servers don't understand what the
	numeric nick ERROR is supposed to mean, so they ignore error
	messages, resulting in not knowing why we were rejected; use
	sendcmdto_one for servers and sendrawto_one for clients

2001-07-17  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/m_burst.c (ms_burst): in the case of a modeless channel and
	a nick collide, a bare BURST may be propagated; adjust the
	enforced parameter count to accept the bare BURST

2001-07-12  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_bsd.c: mark a client as having been IP checked

	* ircd/IPcheck.c (ip_registry_check_remote): remove unneeded
	second call to SetIPChecked()

2001-07-11  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/engine_poll.c: deal with POLLHUP properly (hopefully)

	* ircd/engine_devpoll.c: deal with POLLHUP properly (hopefully)

2001-07-09  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/os_bsd.c (os_get_rusage): move buf into the two ifdef'd
	sections so that if neither is used, the declaration of buf will
	not elicit an "unused variable" warning under NetBSD

	* ircd/m_map.c: include string.h to declare strcpy (fix warnings
	on alpha)

	* ircd/m_away.c: include string.h to declare strcpy/strlen (fix
	warnings on alpha)

	* ircd/ircd_log.c: include string.h to declare strcpy/strlen (fix
	warnings on alpha)

	* ircd/client.c: include string.h to declare memset (fix warnings
	on alpha)

	* ircd/channel.c: remove unused functions next_overlapped_ban,
	del_banid, and is_deopped (fix warnings under -O1)

	* ircd/IPcheck.c: include string.h to declare memset/memcpy (fix
	warnings on alpha)

2001-06-29  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_user.c (set_user_mode): clear the snomask if the user
	isn't supposed to receive server notices anymore

	* ircd/ircd_features.c: change CONFIG_OPERCMDS to default to FALSE

	* configure.in: use AC_MSG_CHECKING/AC_MSG_RESULT when checking
	installation prefix; default devpoll and kqueue to on (they get
	turned off if the required headers aren't present)

	* ircd/whocmds.c (do_who): use ircd_snprintf() instead of
	sprintf_irc(); it's a bit hackish, but it'll do for now

	* ircd/support.c: remove unused #include

	* ircd/send.c: remove unused #include

	* ircd/s_user.c: use ircd_snprintf() instead of sprintf_irc()

	* ircd/s_serv.c: remove unused #include

	* ircd/s_misc.c: use ircd_snprintf() and friends instead of
	sprintf_irc() and friends

	* ircd/s_err.c: moved atoi_tab[] from ircd/sprintf_irc.c to
	ircd/s_err.c, which is the only other file to refer to it

	* ircd/s_conf.c (conf_add_deny): use ircd_snprintf() instead of
	sprintf_irc()

	* ircd/s_bsd.c (connect_server): use ircd_snprintf() instead of
	sprintf_irc()

	* ircd/s_auth.c: use ircd_snprintf() instead of sprintf_irc()

	* ircd/res.c: use ircd_snprintf() instead of sprintf_irc()

	* ircd/m_version.c: use ircd_snprintf() instead of sprintf_irc()

	* ircd/m_kill.c: use ircd_snprintf() instead of sprintf_irc()

	* ircd/listener.c: use ircd_snprintf() instead of sprintf_irc()

	* ircd/gline.c: use ircd_snprintf() instead of sprintf_irc()

	* ircd/channel.c: don't include sprintf_irc.h; use ircd_snprintf()
	instead of sprintf_irc()

	* ircd/Makefile.in: remove sprintf_irc.c from sources list; run
	make depend

	* include/ircd_string.h: remove declaration of sprintf_irc() (what
	was it doing here anyway?)

	* include/sprintf_irc.h: removed unneeded source file

	* ircd/sprintf_irc.c: removed unneeded source file

2001-06-28  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/Makefile.in: tune for VPATH builds/installs; add a rule to
	force bin directory to be created if necessary prior to
	installation; run make depend

	* doc/Makefile.in (install): tune for VPATH installs by cd'ing to
	the ${srcdir}

	* Makefile.in: tune to detect Makefile.in changes in
	subdirectories and to create installation directory indicated by
	${prefix}

	* ircd/whocmds.c (count_users): routine to count the number of
	users matching a given user@host mask

	* ircd/s_err.c: add error messages for ERR_LONGMASK,
	ERR_TOOMANYUSERS, and ERR_MASKTOOWIDE

	* ircd/m_gline.c: look for and advance past '!' flag on G-lines
	from operators; only set GLINE_OPERFORCE flag if oper has the
	PRIV_WIDE_GLINE privilege

	* ircd/ircd_features.c: add GLINEMAXUSERCOUNT, which is the
	maximum number of users a G-line can impact before it has to be
	forced; OPER_WIDE_GLINE, to allow operators to use ! to force a
	wide G-line to be set; and LOCOP_WIDE_GLINE, to allow local
	operators to use ! to force a wide G-line to be set

	* ircd/gline.c: make make_gline() be called with separate user and
	host arguments, and not call canon_userhost() directly; implement
	gline_checkmask() to verify that a host mask is acceptable; move
	BADCHAN check up in gline_add(), and check passed-in mask under
	certain circumstances for acceptability; fix call to
	sendto_opmask_butone() to handle separation of userhost into user
	and host in gline_add(); update call to make_gline()

	* ircd/client.c: use FEAT_OPER_WIDE_GLINE and
	FEAT_LOCOP_WIDE_GLINE to set PRIV_WIDE_GLINE for an operator; add
	PRIV_WIDE_GLINE to privtab[] for client_report_privs()

	* include/whocmds.h (count_users): declare routine to count users
	matching a given user@host mask

	* include/numeric.h: added three new error returns: ERR_LONGMASK
	-- mask can't be formatted into a buffer; ERR_TOOMANYUSERS -- too
	many users would be impacted by the mask; ERR_MASKTOOWIDE -- mask
	contains wildcards in the wrong places

	* include/ircd_features.h: add FEAT_GLINEMAXUSERCOUNT,
	FEAT_OPER_WIDE_GLINE, and FEAT_LOCOP_WIDE_GLINE

	* include/gline.h (GLINE_OPERFORCE): provides a way for m_gline()
	to signal to gline_add() that the operator attempted to force the
	G-line to be set

	* include/client.h (PRIV_WIDE_GLINE): new privilege for operators

	* doc/readme.gline: update to document new "!" prefix to a G-line
	user@host mask

	* doc/readme.features: document GLINEMAXUSERCOUNT,
	OPER_WIDE_GLINE, and LOCOP_WIDE_GLINE

	* doc/example.conf: update to mention new features along with
	their defaults

2001-06-27  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* doc/example.conf: updated example.conf from Braden
	<dbtem@yahoo.com>

	* include/supported.h: forward-port from pl15

2001-06-25  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/whocmds.c: include ircd_policy.h and implement
	HEAD_IN_SAND_WHO_OPCOUNT--forward-port from pl15

	* ircd/m_whois.c: forward-port of the idle-time hiding code from
	pl15; this also required passing parc into do_whois(), which also
	meant passing parc into do_wilds()--*sigh*

	* include/ircd_policy.h: add a couple more HEAD_IN_SAND
	#define's--WHOIS_IDLETIME and WHO_HOPCOUNT

2001-06-22  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* tools/wrapper.c: add a wrapper program that can be used to
	adjust file descriptor limits and root directories; program must
	be run as root--NOT SETUID!--and given appropriate -u arguments

	* doc/readme.log: documentation of how to configure logging

	* doc/readme.features: documentation of each feature (except for
	logging)

2001-06-21  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (config): add a deprecation notice with a pointer to
	tools/transition

	copying over all the necessary libraries so they can be found

2001-06-20  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* INSTALL: partial update of INSTALL for u2.10.11 release...

2001-06-14  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/table_gen.c (makeTables): finally got tired of the
	"overflow in implicit conversion" warning, so just got rid of it
	by explicitly casting UCHAR_MAX to a (default) char; diffs show no
	differences in the tables generated

2001-06-11  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/send.c (sendcmdto_match_butone): don't let the server crash
	if a client is in the STAT_CONNECTING status

2001-06-10  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/send.c: remove unused vsendcmdto_one(), consolidating it
	into sendcmdto_one(); define new sendcmdto_prio_one(), which
	places the message into the priority queue

	* ircd/s_user.c (hunt_server_prio_cmd): definition of
	hunt_server_prio_cmd(), which simply calls sendcmdto_prio_one()
	instead of sendcmdto_one()

	* ircd/m_settime.c: use sendcmdto_prio_one() and
	hunt_server_prio_cmd() to send SETTIME

	* ircd/m_server.c: use sendcmdto_prio_one() to send SETTIME

	* include/send.h: removed declaration for unused vsendcmdto_one();
	added a declaration for sendcmdto_prio_one()

	* include/s_user.h: declare hunt_server_prio_cmd(), which calls
	sendcmdto_prio_one()

	* ircd/send.c (sendcmdto_flag_butone): oops; /wallops should be
	put in the server's priority queue, too...

	* ircd/ircd.c: don't check LPATH for accessibility at all

2001-06-08  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	in SERVER commands

	* ircd/s_bsd.c (completed_connection): send a +h flag in our
	SERVER command if we're configured as a hub

	* ircd/m_server.c: implement parv[7] as a mode-like string; +h
	sets the FLAGS_HUB flag for a server; +s sets the FLAGS_SERVICE
	flag for a server; +hs sets both flags; also modify CMD_SERVER
	format string to send the flags

	* include/client.h: define two new flags, FLAGS_HUB and
	FLAGS_SERVICE to mark services and hubs as such; define testing
	macros, setting macros

	* ircd/s_user.c: remove deprecated struct Gline* argument to
	register_user(); remove GLINE rebroadcast; do not send GLINE
	acknowledgement parameter to NICK; do not look for GLINE
	acknowledgement parameter to NICK while parsing

	register_user()

	* ircd/m_server.c: remove deprecated argument to server_estab();
	remove documentation comment regarding JUPE acknowledgement
	parameter to SERVER; remove JUPE rebroadcast

	* ircd/m_pong.c (mr_pong): remove deprecated argument to
	register_user()

	* ircd/m_nick.c: remove documentation comment regarding GLINE
	acknowledgement parameter to NICK

	* ircd/ircd.c: remove deprecated chroot() code; remove deprecated
	setuid code; correct ancient DEBUG vs DEBUGMODE typo

	* ircd/gline.c: use user's real name in GLINE server notices if
	HEAD_IN_SAND_SNOTICES is defined

	* ircd/channel.c (modebuf_flush_int): make apparent source be
	local server, not oper's server; use user's real name in hack
	notices and DESYNC notices if HEAD_IN_SAND_SNOTICES is defined

	deprecated struct Gline argument from register_user()

	* include/s_serv.h: remove struct Jupe pre-declaration; remove
	deprecated struct Jupe argument from server_estab()

	* ircd/s_stats.c (hunt_stats): forward-port from pl15 of all the
	changes required to control remote stats

	* ircd/s_numeric.c (do_numeric): rewrite numeric origins if
	recipient is not an operator and HEAD_IN_SAND_REWRITE is defined
	[forward-port from pl15]

	* ircd/m_whowas.c (m_whowas): report server name only if requester
	is an operator [forward-port from pl15]

	* ircd/m_whois.c (do_whois): /whois <mynick> now correctly reports
	my server; if HEAD_IN_SAND_REMOTE is 1, ignore the middle argument
	and obtain the report from the user's server [forward-port from
	pl15]

	* ircd/m_who.c: add missing include for ircd_policy.h
	[forward-port from pl15]

	* ircd/m_version.c (m_version): require oper access for remote
	/version if HEAD_IN_SAND_REMOTE is 1 [forward-port from pl15]

	HEAD_IN_SAND_REMOTE is 1 [forward-port from pl15]

	* ircd/m_lusers.c (m_lusers): require oper access for remote
	/lusers if HEAD_IN_SAND_REMOTE is 1 [forward-port from pl15]

	* ircd/m_burst.c (ms_burst): server-added bans are stored using
	local server name, to hide remote server names; modes also are to
	originate from the local server [forward-port from pl15]

	* ircd/m_admin.c (m_admin): require oper access for remote /admin
	if HEAD_IN_SAND_REMOTE is 1 [forward-port from pl15]

	* ircd/channel.c (add_banid): if a server is adding a ban, use my
	server name to hide the remote server's name [forward-port from
	pl15]

	* ircd/Makefile.in: ran make depend

	* include/s_stats.h: hunt_stats() has to have an extra argument to
	support the forward-port from pl15

	* include/ircd_policy.h: #define HEAD_IN_SAND_STATS_P; add
	HEAD_IN_SAND_{BANWHO,REWRITE,REMOTE} [forward-port from pl15]

	* ircd/engine_poll.c (engine_loop): remove bogus assert that I
	forgot to check in the events branch

2001-06-06  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/res.c (init_resolver): don't start DNS expires with a 0
	relative timeout--if the server starts slow, timeouts could be
	messy...there's probably a better solution, but this'll do for now

	* ircd/os_solaris.c: _XOPEN_SOURCE doesn't get along with Solaris
	headers very well; include stropts.h; define an os_set_tos()

	* ircd/os_generic.c (os_set_tos): added an os_set_tos() for
	os_generic.c

	* ircd/ircd.c: if there are no C-lines, we don't want to have a
	timer that expires at the absolute time of 0--it kinda blocks all
	the other timers!

	* ircd/engine_devpoll.c: some includes for open(); declare errcode
	and codesize in engine_loop()

	* ircd/list.c (free_client): remove bogus check on timer active
	flag

	* ircd/s_auth.c: pull out destruction code in
	auth_timeout_request() into an externally-visible
	destroy_auth_request(); manage cli_auth pointer in client
	structure; use it for an extra assertion check

	* ircd/list.c: include s_auth.h for destroy_auth_request(); add
	debugging notices to show flow when deallocating
	connections/clients; call destroy_auth_request() when free'ing a
	client that has an auth outstanding; don't free the connection if
	the process timer is unmarked but still active

	* ircd/ircd_events.c: set GEN_ACTIVE when initializing a generator
	and reset it before calling the event handler for an ET_DESTROY
	event

	* include/s_auth.h (destroy_auth_request): declare
	destroy_auth_request(), which can be used to destroy an
	outstanding auth request if a client socket goes away before the
	auth exchange is completed

	* include/ircd_events.h: add an active flag to keep track of
	whether or not particular generators are active, for the
	convenience of functions using the API

	* include/client.h: add a pointer for auth requests to struct
	Connection so we can kill outstanding auth requests if a client
	socket closes unexpectedly

	* ircd/s_bsd.c: cli_connect() could become 0 during the course of
	the sock or timer callback; take that into account in the assert

	* ircd/list.c: add magic number checking and setting--magic
	numbers are zero'd on frees to detect double-frees; add back
	setting of cli_from() to 0 to break the back-link from the struct
	Connection (duh)

	* ircd/ircd.c: set me's magic number correctly

	* include/client.h: define magic numbers and accessor/verifier
	macros

	* ircd/list.c: assert that dealloc_client() is called with
	cli_connect(cptr) == 0; set cli_connect(cptr) to 0 before calling
	dealloc_client(); don't mess with cli_from(cptr)

	* ircd/s_bsd.c: only attempt to dealloc a connection if the
	associated client has already been destroyed, or at least delinked

2001-06-05  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/list.c (free_client): only try to delete the socket when
	the fd hasn't already been closed, avoiding a double-free

	* ircd/list.c (free_connection): make sure the client is really
	gone before doing away with the connection

	* ircd/s_bsd.c: record that socket has been added in con_freeflag
	field; queue a socket_del() as soon as the socket is close()'d;
	use con_freeflag & FREEFLAG_TIMER instead of con_timer; clear
	FREEFLAG_SOCKET on ET_DESTROY event in client_sock_callback(),
	then dealloc the connection if safe; mark socket as dead when
	there's a read error or EOF; clear FREEFLAG_TIMER flag upon entry
	to client_timer_callback(); dealloc connection if safe upon
	ET_DESTROY event in client_timer_callback()

	* ircd/list.c: use con_freeflag instead of con_timer; only dealloc
	the connection if both socket and timer have been destroyed;
	destroy both socket and timer explicitly and carefully

	* include/client.h: replace the con_timer field with a
	con_freeflag field, to indicate what still needs freeing; define
	the freeflags

	* ircd/engine_select.c (engine_loop): duh...sockList[i] could
	become 0

	* ircd/engine_devpoll.c (engine_loop): duh...sockList[i] could
	become 0

	* ircd/s_bsd.c: add some extra assertions to try to track down a
	corruption problem

	* ircd/engine_select.c (engine_loop): add an extra assert to try
	to track down a corruption problem

	* ircd/engine_poll.c (engine_loop): add an extra assert to try to
	track down a corruption problem

	* ircd/engine_kqueue.c (engine_loop): add an extra assert to try
	to track down a corruption problem

	* ircd/engine_devpoll.c (engine_loop): skip slots that have become
	empty during processing; add an extra assert to try to track down
	a corruption problem

	* ircd/engine_kqueue.c (engine_delete): make sure to zero deleted
	entries

2001-06-04  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_bsd.c (client_sock_callback): client is no longer
	blocked, so we must mark it as unblocked

	* ircd/engine_select.c: add Debug() calls galore; add handling for
	SS_NOTSOCK; use a dummy sock variable to keep things from
	disappearing on us; correct timeout calculation; update nfds for
	efficiency

	* ircd/engine_poll.c: use new debugging level (DEBUG_ENGINE);
	remove a spurious "if (sock)" which will always be true; update
	nfds for efficiency

	* ircd/engine_kqueue.c: add Debug() calls galore; add handling for
	SS_NOTSOCK (just in case); correct timeout calculation

	* ircd/engine_devpoll.c: add Debug() calls galore; add handling
	for SS_NOTSOCK; correct timeout calculation; add EAGAIN handling

	* include/s_debug.h (DEBUG_ENGINE): add new debugging level;
	pretty-indent numbers

	* ircd/engine_poll.c (engine_loop): break out SS_NOTSOCK
	case--it's not a socket; the check for writability is most likely
	not needed, but present for completeness

2001-05-24  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_bsd.c: add Debug messages; call read_packet() even if the
	no newline flag is set; call read_packet() when the timer expires,
	regardless of what's in the buffer--read_packet() should be able
	to deal properly

	* ircd/IPcheck.c (ip_registry_connect_succeeded): correct a NOTICE
	sent to clients to include the client nickname (duh)

	* ircd/ircd_events.c: don't destroy a timer if it's already marked
	for destruction; replace a missing ! in socket_del()

	* ircd/engine_poll.c (engine_loop): reference a temporary variable
	so we don't have to worry about sockList[i] going away

	* ircd/s_bsd.c (client_sock_callback): add Debug messages

	* ircd/s_auth.c: add Debug messages all over the place

	* ircd/ircd_events.c: add and edit some Debug messages; add a list
	of routines to convert some of the enums and flags from numbers
	into human-readable strings for the Debug messages

	* ircd/engine_poll.c: hack some Debug messages to use the new name
	conversion routines in ircd_events.c; add an extra assert for a
	condition that shouldn't ever happen; apparently recv() can return
	EAGAIN when poll() returns readable--I wonder why...

	* include/ircd_events.h: declare some helper routines under
	DEBUGMODE

2001-05-23  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_bsd.c (client_sock_callback): add an extra assertion
	check

	* ircd/s_auth.c: add more Debug messages

	* ircd/list.c (make_client): add an extra assertion check

	* ircd/ircd_events.c (socket_events): don't call the engine events
	changer if we haven't actually made any changes to the event mask

	* ircd/uping.c: add some Debug messages

	* ircd/s_stats.c: document new /STATS e

	* ircd/s_err.c: add RPL_STATSENGINE to report the engine name

	* ircd/s_bsd.c: remove static client_timer variable; in
	read_packet(), if there's still data in the client's recvQ after
	parsing, add a 2 second timer (con_proc); fix the ET_DESTROY case
	of client_sock_callback to handle destroying the timer properly;
	rewrote client_timer_callback from scratch to be called on an
	individual client

	* ircd/m_stats.c: add /STATS e to report the engine name

	* ircd/list.c: deal with con_timer field in struct Connection
	properly; correct a core-level bug in remove_client_from_list--if
	the client is the only one in the list, we try to update
	GlobalClientList's cli_prev pointer--not good

	* ircd/ircd.c: remove call to init_client_timer()

	* ircd/engine_poll.c: made Debug messages more uniform by
	prepending "poll:" to them all; corrected an off-by-one error that
	caused poll_count to be 1 less than the actual count and removed
	my work-around; added Debug messages to indicate which socket is
	being checked and what the results are

	* ircd/Makefile.in: ran a make depend

	* include/s_bsd.h: remove init_client_timer(), since we're doing
	it differently now

	* include/numeric.h (RPL_STATSENGINE): a stats reply to report the
	engine name

	* include/ircd_policy.h (HEAD_IN_SAND_STATS_E): turn off /stats e
	reports for non-opers

	* include/client.h: add con_timer and con_proc fields to struct
	Connection and define accessor macros--con_timer marks that
	con_proc contains a valid timer, and con_proc is used to pace user
	data

	* ircd/s_bsd.c (close_connection): let free_client() destroy the
	socket

	* ircd/s_auth.c (start_auth): add a Debug call to indicate when
	auth has begun on a client

	* ircd/ircd_events.c: ensure that event_execute() is called with a
	non-NULL event; modify event_add() macro to properly zero list
	bits; modify gen_dequeue() to not try to clip it out of a list
	it's already been clipped out of; change signal socket
	initialization to use state SS_NOTSOCK; permit timeout values of
	0 in add_timer(); add many Debug calls; change socket_del() and
	timer_del() to always set the GEN_DESTROY flag; use GEN_MARKED in
	timer_run() instead of GEN_DESTROY so that event_generate() will
	pass on the events; remove the switch and replace with a simpler
	if-then-else tree in timer_run(); don't allow destroyed sockets to
	be destroyed again, nor their states or event masks to be changed

	* ircd/ircd.c: initialize "running" to 1

	* ircd/engine_poll.c: deal with SS_NOTSOCK "sockets"; add Debug
	messages all over the place; fix a counting problem in
	engine_add(); turn wait into a signed integer and set it to -1
	only if timer_next() returns 0; adjust wait time to be relative;
	don't call gen_ref_dec() if socket disappeared while we were
	processing it

	* include/ircd_events.h: the pipe for signals is not a socket, so
	we must mark it as such--added SS_NOTSOCK for that special socket;
	events won't be generated if GEN_DESTROY is on, so add GEN_MARKED
	for the benefit of timer_run()

	* configure.in: add --enable-pedantic and --enable-warnings to
	turn on (and off) -Wall -pedantic in CFLAGS

2001-05-21  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_conf.c: change "s_addr" element accesses to "address"
	element accesses

	* include/s_conf.h: on some systems, "s_addr" is a macro; use
	"address" instead

2001-05-18  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/engine_kqueue.c: include ircd_alloc.h; set_or_clear returns
	void in this file; add a missing semi-colon; declare errcode,
	codesize

	* ircd/uping.c (uping_sender_callback): it's pptr, not uping

	* ircd/s_user.c (register_user): comment out spurious reference to
	nextping

	* ircd/s_serv.c (server_estab): comment out spurious reference to
	nextping

	* ircd/s_conf.c (read_configuration_file): comment out spurious
	reference to nextping and nextconnect

	* ircd/s_bsd.c: comment out some spurious references to formerly
	global (now non-existant) variables; correct a couple of typos

	* ircd/s_auth.c: pre-declare some functions referenced in the
	callback; correct a typo

	* ircd/res.c (start_resolver): pass errno value of ENFILE

	* ircd/listener.c (accept_connection): you know your API is messed
	up when...variables that shouldn't have been global crop up in
	other files

	* ircd/list.c (free_client): substitution of == for =

	* ircd/ircd_signal.c: include assert.h for assertion checking;
	check ev_data() to find out what signal generated event

	* ircd/ircd_events.c: some references to the variable "timer"
	should have been references to the variable "ptr"

	* ircd/engine_select.c: it's struct fd_set, not struct fdset;
	ev_timer(ev) is already a timer pointer; declare codesize as a
	size_t to correct signedness issue; use timer_next(), not
	time_next()

	* ircd/engine_poll.c: ev_timer(ev) is already a timer pointer;
	select fd out of struct pollfd in assertion checking; declare
	errcode and codesize; use timer_next(), not time_next()

	* ircd/engine_kqueue.c: ev_timer(ev) is already a timer pointer;
	use function timer_next(), not time_next()

	* ircd/engine_devpoll.c: ev_timer(ev) is already a timer pointer;
	use function timer_next(), not time_next()

	* ircd/Makefile.in (IRCD_SRC): add ircd_events.c to the list of
	compiled sources; do make depend

	* include/list.h: pre-declare struct Connection

	* include/ircd_events.h (gen_ref_inc): cast to the right structure
	name

	* include/s_auth.h: duh; missing */

2001-05-10  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/send.c: update write events status after sending data or
	accumulating data to be sent

	* ircd/m_list.c (m_list): update write events status after
	canceling a running /list

	* ircd/channel.c (list_next_channels): update write events status
	after listing a few channels

	* ircd/s_bsd.c: extensive changes to update to new events model;
	remove on_write_unblocked() and the two implementations of
	read_message(), which have been deprecated by this change

	* ircd/s_auth.c: set the socket events we're interested in for
	clients; simplify some logic that does the connect_nonb followed
	by the socket_add

	* ircd/list.c: define free_connection() to free a connection
	that's become freeable once the struct Socket has been
	deallocated; fix up free_client() to take this new behavior into
	account

	* ircd/ircd.c: call init_client_timer()

	* include/s_bsd.h: declare new REGISTER_ERROR_MESSAGE when unable
	to register connect-in-progress with events system; declare
	init_client_timer() (HACK!) to preserve rate-limiting behavior

	* include/list.h: declare new free_connection()

	* include/client.h: add a struct Socket to struct Connection

2001-05-09  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/ircd_signal.c: massage the handlers for SIGHUP, SIGINT, and
	SIGTERM into event callbacks; perform the actions in the
	callbacks, since they're not called in the context of the signal;
	set up the signal callbacks in the event engine

	* ircd/ircd_events.c (signal_callback): we're supposed to look for
	a specific signal; don't generate an event if there is no signal
	structure for it

	* ircd/ircd.c: nuke nextconnect and nextping and replace them with
	connect_timer and ping_timer; massage try_connections() and
	check_pings() into timer callbacks that re-add themselves at the
	right time; remove ircd.c's "event_loop()"; initialize the event
	system and the connect_timer and ping_timer

	* ircd/uping.c: correct a couple more typos

	* ircd/s_auth.c: rework to use new events system

	* ircd/os_solaris.c (os_connect_nonb): update to new interface

	AuthRequest, replacing them with struct Socket and struct Timer
	structures; add flags to indicate when these structures have been
	released by the event system; remove the deprecated
	timeout_auth_queries()

	* include/ircd_osdep.h (os_connect_nonb): connect could complete
	immediately, so change the interface to handle that possibility

	* ircd/uping.c (uping_server): noticed and corrected a typo

	* ircd/listener.c: set up to use ircd_event's struct Socket by
	adding an socket_add() call to inetport(), replacing
	free_listener() with socket_del() in close_listener(), and
	reworking accept_connection to be called as the callback

	* ircd/ircd.c: add a call to IPcheck_init()

	* ircd/IPcheck.c: remove IPcheck_expire(); rework
	ip_registry_expire() to be called from a timer; write
	IPcheck_init() to set up the expiration timer (hard-coded for a
	60-second expiration time)

	* include/listener.h: add a struct Socket to the struct Listener;
	remove accept_connection()

	* include/IPcheck.h: add IPcheck_init(), remove IPcheck_expire()

2001-05-08  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/ircd_events.c: include config.h; use USE_KQUEUE and
	USE_DEVPOLL instead of HAVE_KQUEUE and HAVE_DEVPOLL_H

2001-04-23  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_misc.c (exit_client): make netsplit server notice say the
	right thing

	change to make Khaled happy...

	* ircd/m_whois.c (do_whois): pull-up of m_whois() fix
	(do_whois): duh...

2001-04-21  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/msgq.c: finally remove the msgq_integrity() hack, as it's
	turned up no more bugs

	* ircd/ircd.c: use /* */ comments instead of // comments--all the
	world's not gcc :(

	// comments--all the world's not gcc :(

	* ircd/runmalloc.c: finally garbage-collect unused file

	* ircd/<multiple files>: addition of '#include "config.h"' before
	all other includes in most .c files

	* include/<multiple files>: remove includes of config.h, which are
	now going into the raw .c files

2001-04-20  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/m_whois.c (do_whois): display proper server name if the
	user is looking up himself

	* ircd/m_who.c (m_who): disable match by servername or display of
	server names by non-opers

	* include/ircd_policy.h: add define for
	HEAD_IN_SAND_WHO_SERVERNAME to cover full intent of sub-motion 15
	of CFV 165

2001-04-18  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_conf.c: keep the $R in memory so we can see it clearly
	when we do a /stats k

2001-04-16  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/send.c (sendcmdto_flag_butone): recast to just broadcast to
	all servers, rather than to only servers that have +w/+g/whatever
	users on them; among other things, this removes that atrocity
	known as sentalong[] from this function

	* ircd/m_admin.c: must include ircd.h to declare "me"; must
	include hash.h to declare FindUser()

	* ircd/m_wallusers.c: implementation of WALLUSERS

2001-04-13  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/uping.c: refit to use the new events interface

	* ircd/res.c: refit to use the new events interface

	* ircd/ircd_events.c: create timer_chg(), which permits a
	(non-periodic) timer's expire time to be modified; change the
	logic in timer_run() so that timers that were re-added while the
	event was being processed will not be destroyed prematurely

	* include/uping.h: include the events header, declare some extra
	fields in struct UPing, remove timeout value, and define some
	flags for marking which cleanup items have yet to be done

	* include/ircd_events.h: add a prototype for timer_chg() to change
	the expire time of a running timer

2001-03-13 Joseph Bongaarts <foxxe@wtfs.net>
	* ircd/os_openbsd.c: Tweaked the openbsd hack a bit.
	
2001-03-07  Joseph Bongaarts  <foxxe@wtfs.net>

	* config/configure.in: Add check for OpenBSD

	* ircd/os_openbsd.c: Add seperate os dep file for openbsd which
	differs from generic BSD, particularly in its handling of
	_XOPEN_SOURCE.
	
2001-02-12  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/m_gline.c (ms_gline): propagate a G-line that happened to
	have been added by a U-lined server, rather than going through the
	activate/deactivate logic; propagate G-line removals by U-lined
	servers as well

	* ircd/gline.c: rename propagate_gline() to gline_propagate();
	make gline_propagate() return an int 0 (convenience return); only
	update lastmod in gline_activate() and gline_deactivate() if the
	current lastmod is non-zero, since 0 lastmod is our flag of a
	U-lined server having added a G-line

	* include/gline.h (gline_propagate): exporting the G-line
	propagation function

	* ircd/m_list.c (m_list): duh; permit explicit channel name
	specification only when /list gets two arguments ("Kev
	#wasteland") rather than when /list gets more than two
	arguments--nice braino

2001-01-29  Thomas Helvey <twhelvey1@home.com>

	* ircd/ircd_reply.c (need_more_params): fix bug that allowed
	unregistered clients to spam opers with protocol violation
	messages. Note: the bugfix may have eliminated some useful
	protocol violation messages.
	Please send protocol violation messages explicitly from the
	functions they are discovered in, you have much better context
	for the error there and it helps to document the behavior of the
	server. This was also a design bug in that it violated the
	"A function should do one thing" heuristic. Patching this one
	would have resulted in a continuous spawning of other bugs over
	the next 3 years, so I killed it. Check around for stuff this
	broke and readd the calls to protocol_violation in the functions
	that need to send the message.

2001-01-29  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/channel.c (mode_parse_ban): stopper a tiny leak--if a ban
	already existed, then the logic would (attempt to) skip it, but
	would not free the ban string; now the ban string is free'd and
	the ban count is decremented, releasing the ban for use

	* ircd/s_user.c: make send_umode_out() take a prop argument
	instead of testing for the PRIV_PROPAGATE privilege itself; fix
	set_umode() to use this new argument, calculating it before
	calculating the new privileges for a -o'd user

	* ircd/m_oper.c (m_oper): pass the new prop argument to
	send_umode_out()

	* ircd/channel.c (mode_parse_ban): turn off MODE_ADD bit in bans
	that we're not actually going to add because they already exist;
	test that particular bit before adding to the linked list

	* include/s_user.h: add a prop argument to send_umode_out() to
	indicate whether or not to propagate the user mode

2001-01-24  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/msgq.c: ircd_vsnprintf() returns the number of bytes that
	it would have written; upper-bound the number to prevent overflows
	by proxy; also, tune buffer size given to ircd_vsnprintf() to take
	into account the fact that ircd_vsnprintf() already takes the
	terminal \0 into account

2001-01-22  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/msgq.c: add an incredibly ugly hack to attempt to track
	down an apparent buffer overflow; remove msgq_map(), since it's no
	longer used anywhere; slight tweaks to prevent off-by-one errors,
	but these can't explain the problems we've seen

	* include/msgq.h: remove msgq_map(), since it's no longer used
	anywhere

2001-01-18  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_user.c (set_nick_name): call client_set_privs() after
	parsing user modes

2001-01-17  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_bsd.c (read_message): fix a typo in the select version of
	read_message()

	* ircd/whowas.c (whowas_free): MyFree() is a macro that expects
	its argument to be an lvalue, which means we can't use
	whowas_clean()'s handy-dandy "return ww" feature

	* ircd/ircd_features.c: default LOCOP_KILL to TRUE--oops...

2001-01-16  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/ircd_events.c (timer_run): it's possible that the timer got
	deleted during the callback processing, so don't go to the bother
	of requeuing it if the destroy flag is set

	* ircd/engine_select.c: define FD_SETSIZE to be IRCD_FD_SETSIZE
	out of config.h if this is a *BSD; include errno.h (oops);
	decrement error count after an hour using a timer; use FD_SETSIZE
	constant instead of IRCD_FD_SETSIZE constant; fill in event
	processing code

	* ircd/engine_poll.c: include errno.h (oops); decrement error
	count after an hour using a timer; fill in event processing code

	* ircd/engine_kqueue.c: include errno.h (oops); decrement error
	count after an hour using a timer; assert events filter is either
	EVFILT_READ or EVFILT_WRITE; fill in event processing code

	* ircd/engine_devpoll.c: include errno.h (oops); decrement error
	count after an hour using a timer; fill in event processing code

2001-01-15  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/client.c: fixed feattab; basically, when I changed features
	to use small integers specifying bit positions, instead of the
	bits themselves, I forgot to update feattab to not | these
	privileges together; also fixed a bug in the antiprivs masking
	loop in client_set_privs()--last index wouldn't get parsed

2001-01-11  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/ircd_events.c: call event_generate() with new data
	argument; make it set that field in struct Event; make
	socket_add() return the value of the eng_add callback

	* ircd/engine_select.c: make engine_add() return a
	successful/unsuccessful status; add bounds-checking outside of an
	assert; use accessor macros; use log_write(), not the deprecated
	ircd_log(); add an assert to engine_loop() to double-check for
	data structure corruption

	* ircd/engine_poll.c: make engine_add() return a
	successful/unsuccessful status; add bounds-checking outside of an
	assert; use accessor macros; use log_write(), not the deprecated
	ircd_log(); add an assert to engine_loop() to double-check for
	data structure corruption

	* ircd/engine_kqueue.c: implementation of an engine for kqueue()

	* ircd/engine_devpoll.c: implementation of an engine for /dev/poll

	* include/ircd_events.h: define some accessor macros; add ev_data
	to struct Event for certain important data--errno values, for
	instance; make EngineAdd callback tell us if it was successful or
	not; add extra argument to event_generate(); make socket_add()
	return the status from EngineAdd

2001-01-10  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/ircd_events.c: pass initializer information about how many
	total _filedescriptors_ may be opened at once

	* ircd/ircd.c: use exported "running" instead of unexported
	thisServer.running

	* ircd/engine_select.c: implementation of an event engine based on
	select()

	* ircd/engine_poll.c: implementation of an event engine based on
	poll()

	* include/ircd_events.h: pass the engine initializer an integer
	specifing how many _filedescriptors_ may be opened at once

	* include/ircd.h: running has to be exported for the engine_*
	event loops

2001-01-09  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/ircd_events.c: include some needed headers; add some
	comments; make evEngines[] const; bundle sig_sock and sig_fd into
	a struct named sigInfo; rework struct evInfo to have a queue of
	_generators_, and only when threaded; added a gen_init() function
	to centralize generator initialization; fix various compile-time
	errors; rework event_add() for new queueing scheme and checked for
	compile-time errors; add casts where needed; spell evEngines[]
	correctly; make engine_name() return const char*

	* include/ircd_events.h: type EventCallBack depends on struct
	Event, so pre-declare it; put _event_ queue into generators, and
	only when threaded; give engine data a union to store both ints
	and pointers; make engine name a const; fix gen_ref_dec() macro;
	make engine_name() return a const char*

	* ircd/ircd_events.c: gen_dequeue() is now exported, so move it
	down with the non-static functions; modify event_execute() to use
	the new gen_ref_dec() to simplify code; make sure event_generate()
	does not generate new events for generators marked for destruction

	* include/ircd_events.h: the engines, at least, may need to modify
	reference counts to keep generators from going away while
	something still points at them, so add reference counter
	manipulators and export gen_dequeue() for them

	* ircd/ircd_events.c: set up the list of engines to try; set up
	the signal struct Socket; rename netInfo to evInfo; move static
	functions near the beginning of the file; do away with
	signal_signal() (since we no longer keep a signal count ourselves)
	and call event_generate() directly from signal_callback--also
	renamed some functions; allow signal_callback() to read up to
	SIGS_PER_SOCK at once from the signal pipe; add event_init() to
	initialize the entire event system; add event_loop() to call the
	engine's event loop; initialize new struct GenHeader member,
	gh_engdata; remove timer_next(); add socket_add() function to add
	a socket; add socket_del() to mark a socket for deletion; add
	socket_state() to transition a socket between states; add
	socket_events() to set what events we're interested in on the
	socket; add engine_name() to retrieve event engine's name

	* include/ircd_events.h: add engine data field to struct
	GenHeader; rename SOCK_ACTION_REMOVE to SOCK_ACTION_DEL; add a
	note about states vs s_events; remove signal count; fold union
	Generator back into struct Event; remove count members from struct
	Generators; redefine engine callbacks to not take a struct
	Engine*; add explanatory comments to callback definitions; add
	some engine callbacks to handle operations; remove struct Engine
	flag member--can detect single flag from eng_signal member; add
	event_init(), event_loop(), engine_name(), and the socket_*()
	functions; make timer_next() a macro to avoid a function call

2001-01-08  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* include/ircd_events.h: rename to ircd_events.h, since it handles
	events, not just networking stuff; add signal support; more
	structural rearrangement

	* ircd/ircd_events.c: rename to ircd_events.c, since it handles
	events, not just networking stuff; add signal support; more
	structural rearrangement

2001-01-07  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/ircd_network.c: implement timer API; add reference counts
	appropriately

	* include/ircd_network.h: firm up some pieces of the interface;
	split out members everything has into a separate structure; add
	reference counts; add timer API

2001-01-06  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/ircd_network.c: static data and event manipulation
	functions for new event processing system

	* include/ircd_network.h: data structures for new event processing
	system

2001-01-03  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/whowas.c: Completely re-did the old allocation scheme by
	turning it into a linked list, permitting the
	NICKNAMEHISTORYLENGTH feature to be changed on the fly

	* ircd/s_debug.c (count_memory): use FEAT_NICKNAMEHISTORYLENGTH
	feature instead of old #define

	* ircd/ircd_features.c: add NICKNAMEHISTORYLENGTH feature as an
	integer feature with a notify callback (whowas_realloc)

	* ircd/client.c (client_set_privs): second memset was supposed to
	be over antiprivs, not privs; thanks, Chris Behrens
	<cbehrens@xo.com> for pointing that out...

	* include/whowas.h: new elements for an extra linked list in
	struct Whowas; a notify function for feature value changes

	* include/ircd_features.h: new feature--FEAT_NICKNAMEHISTORYLENGTH

	* config/config-sh.in: NICKNAMEHISTORYLENGTH is now a feature

2001-01-02  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* config/config-sh.in: get rid of DEFAULT_LIST_PARAMETER
	compile-time option--now in features subsystem

	* ircd/motd.c (motd_init): rework motd_init() to be called as the
	notify function for MPATH and RPATH features (should probably
	split it up a bit, though...)

	* ircd/m_privs.c (mo_privs): if called with no parameters, return
	privs of the caller, rather than an error

	* ircd/m_list.c: pull usage message into its own function; pull
	list parameter processing into its own function that does not
	modify the contents of the parameter; add list_set_default() to
	set the default list parameter (uses the notify hook); rework
	m_list() to make use of these functions; removed dead code

	* ircd/ircd_log.c (log_feature_mark): make sure to return 0, since
	we have no notify handler

	* ircd/ircd_features.c: add notify callback for notification of
	value changes; give mark callback an int return value to indicate
	whether or not to call the notify callback; fix up feature macros
	for new notify callback; add DEFAULT_LIST_PARAM feature; rewrite
	string handling in feature_set() to deal with def_str being a null
	pointer; wrote feature_init() to set up all defaults appropriately

	* ircd/ircd.c (main): call feature_init() instead of
	feature_mark(), to avoid calling notify functions while setting up
	defaults

	* ircd/client.c: updated to deal with new privileges structure

	* ircd/class.c: updated so init_class() can be called should one
	of PINGFREQUENCY, CONNECTFREQUENCY, MAXIMUM_LINKS, or
	DEFAULTMAXSENDQLENGTH be changed

	* include/ircd_log.h: log_feature_mark() updated to fit with new
	API changes

	* include/ircd_features.h: added DEFAULT_LIST_PARAM feature and
	feature_init() function (found necessary since adding the notify
	stuff and notifying motd.c during start-up...before we defined
	RPATH!)

	* include/client.h: move privs around to enable addition of more
	bits if necessary; based on the FD_* macros

	* include/channel.h: declare list_set_default (actually located in
	m_list.c *blanche*)

	* ircd/s_user.c: retrieve MAXSILES and MAXSILELENGTH (now
	AVBANLEN*MAXSILES) from features subsystem

	* ircd/s_debug.c (debug_serveropts): CMDLINE_CONFIG doesn't go to
	anything anymore

	* ircd/s_bsd.c: retrieve HANGONGOODLINK and HANGONRETRYDELAY from
	the features subsystem

	* ircd/s_auth.c (start_auth): NODNS migrated to the features
	subsystem

	* ircd/random.c: created random_seed_set() function to set seed
	value, along with some stuff to make ircrandom() a little more
	random--state preserving, xor of time instead of direct usage,
	etc.; it's still a pseudo-random number generator, though, and
	hopefully I haven't broken the randomness

	* ircd/m_version.c: FEATUREVALUES makes use of feature_int() calls

	* ircd/m_join.c: use features interface to retrieve
	MAXCHANNELSPERUSER

	* ircd/ircd_features.c: add NODISP flag for super-secret features;
	add a whole bunch of new features migrated over from make config

	* ircd/ircd.c: use features interface to retrieve PINGFREQUENCY,
	CONNECTTIMEOUT, and TIMESEC

	* ircd/client.c (client_get_ping): use features interface to
	retrieve PINGFREQUENCY

	* ircd/class.c: use features interface to retrieve PINGFREQUENCY,
	CONNECTFREQUENCY, MAXIMUM_LINKS, and DEFAULTMAXSENDQLENGTH

	* ircd/chkconf.c (DEFAULTMAXSENDQLENGTH): since it's now in the
	features subsystem, we have to add something explicit

	* ircd/channel.c: use features interface to retrieve
	KILLCHASETIMELIMIT, MAXBANLENGTH, MAXBANS, and MAXCHANNELSPERUSER;
	note that MAXBANLENGTH is now calculated dynamically from MAXBANS
	and AVBANLEN

	* ircd/Makefile.in: run make depend

	* include/supported.h (FEATURESVALUES): update to reference
	feature settings

	* include/random.h: add prototype for random_seed_set

	* include/ircd_features.h: add several more features

	* include/channel.h: move MAXBANS and MAXBANLENGTH into feature

	feature_report() instead

	* include/numeric.h: added a new error message and shifted old
	values over some--this is, after all, an alpha

	it if it should be using the tty; added a couple of functions
	required by the features API

	* include/ircd_features.h: add an enum and some more functions to
	flesh out the feature API--it should now be possible to put all
	those compile-time constants in the config file!

	* ircd/send.c: got the direction of the assert incorrect...

	* ircd/send.c: implement the efficiency of flush_connections by
	creating a linked list of struct Connection's with queued data;
	also get rid of flush_sendq_except and make sure to yank

	parse all arguments

	* ircd/s_debug.c (count_memory): modify to report for clients and
	connections, not local clients and remote clients

	* ircd/list.c: fiddle with the client-fiddling functions to take
	into account the divorce of struct Connection from struct Client

	* ircd/ircd.c: define a struct Connection for me, initialize it,
	and link it into the right place (ewww, globals!)

	by having gline_deactivate() make sure to turn off the active bit
	and call propagate_gline() if it's a Uworld gline

	* ircd/m_stats.c: use MsgQLength on a sendQ

	* ircd/m_settime.c: use MsgQLength instead of DBufLength on a
	sendQ; mark a piece of dead code

	* ircd/m_names.c: use send_reply instead of sendto_one

	* ircd/m_mode.c: use new mode; remove old dead code

	* ircd/m_ison.c (m_ison): restructure to make use of struct MsgBuf

	* ircd/m_burst.c: use BUFSIZE instead of IRC_BUFSIZE; remove old
	dead code

	struct MsgBuf; remove set_mode, add_token_to_sendbuf, cancel_mode,
	and send_hack_notice; use BUFSIZE instead of IRC_BUFSIZE

	* ircd/Makefile.in: add msgq.c to list of sources; run make depend

	* ircd/IPcheck.c: use sendcmdto_one instead of sendto_one

	* include/send.h: send_buffer now takes a struct MsgBuf * instead
	of a char *; flush_sendq_except now takes no arguments, as sendq
	flushing currently only happens in dbuf.h and sendQ is a struct
	MsgQ; remove prototypes for a lot of old sendto_* functions that
	aren't used anymore; remove sendbuf and IRC_BUFSIZE--the former is
	no longer needed, and the latter is identical to BUFSIZE in
	ircd_defs.h

	* include/s_user.h: make InfoFormatter take a struct MsgBuf*
	instead of a char *; also make it return void, instead of char *

	* ircd/msgq.c: implementation of new MsgQ system

2000-12-06  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/ircd_features.c: #include was supposed to be for
	  ircd_features.h, not features.h--missed when I had to do a
	  rename because of namespace collision

2000-12-05  Greg Sikorski <gte@atomicrevs.demon.co.uk>
	* ircd/m_topic.c: Added missing braces that caused all remote
	  topics to be ignored.

2000-12-04  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/m_create.c: I'm tired of the exit_client warning :)
	(ms_create): discovered that exit_client() was being called with
	too few arguments

	* ircd/s_misc.c (exit_client): remove all dependance on
	FNAME_USERLOG, since that's now gone; log only to LS_USER

	* ircd/s_debug.c: USE_SYSLOG no longer means anything

	* ircd/m_oper.c (m_oper): no longer log to LS_OPERLOG--we already
	log to LS_OPER

	* ircd/m_kill.c: no longer conditionalize on SYSLOG_KILL

	* ircd/ircd_log.c: remove LS_OPERLOG, LS_USERLOG

	* include/ircd_log.h: remove LS_OPERLOG, LS_USERLOG--they serve
	the same purpose as LS_USER and LS_OPER

	ircd_log

	* ircd/res.c (send_res_msg): use log_write instead of ircd_log

	function; fix a couple of bugs

	* ircd/ircd_alloc.c: fixed a comment

	* ircd/ircd.c: use log_write instead of ircd_log; fold server
	notice generation in a couple of cases

	* ircd/gline.c: use log_write instead of write_log; no longer
	conditionalize on GPATH

	* ircd/channel.c (modebuf_flush_int): use log_write instead of
	write_log; no longer conditionalize on OPATH

	* ircd/Makefile.in: run make depend, since dependencies have
	changed

	* doc/example.conf: add system USER to documentation

	* include/ircd_log.h: add system USER; remove old ircd_log()
	declarations

2000-12-04  Isomer <isomer@coders.net>
	* ircd/m_names.c: Add NAMES_EON to do_names to say add a
	'end_of_names' reply when done.
	* ircd/m_join.c: use NAMES_EON as mentioned above

2000-12-01  net  <simms@LUCIDA.QC.CA>

	* ircd/motd.c: add a freelist for struct Motds

2000-11-30  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_stats.c (report_feature_list): report features--only
	local opers can see logging configuration, since it doesn't really
	mean anything to users

	* ircd/s_err.c: add reply messages for new feature subsystem

	* ircd/s_conf.c: add F lines to .conf

	* ircd/parse.c: add the message descriptions for /set, /reset, and
	/get

	* ircd/m_stats.c: add /stats f

	* ircd/m_set.c (mo_set): implement /set

	* ircd/m_reset.c (mo_reset): implement /reset

	* ircd/m_rehash.c: /rehash m now flushes MOTD cache, and /rehash l
	reopens log files (for log file rotation)

	* ircd/m_get.c (mo_get): implement /get

	* ircd/ircd_log.c: use int instead of void return value; add
	log_report_features() and log_canon(); fix a function that
	disappears if DEBUGMODE not #define'd

	* ircd/ircd_features.c: functions to manipulate feature settings
	either from the config file or with the new /set, /reset, and /get
	commands

	* ircd/Makefile.in: add new .c files, run make depend

	* include/s_stats.h: declare report_feature_list() (/stats f
	handler)

	* include/numeric.h: add RPL_STATSFLINE, RPL_FEATURE,
	ERR_NOFEATURE, ERR_BADLOGTYPE, ERR_BADLOGSYS, and ERR_BADLOGVALUE
	reply numerics

	* include/msg.h: add defines for SET, RESET, and GET

	* include/ircd_log.h: add a function to canonicalize subsystem
	names; change some void return values to int

	* include/ircd_features.h: new features subsystem handles all the
	manipulation of special features, like log files

	* include/handlers.h: declare new mo_{s,res,g}et message handlers
	for fiddling with features run-time

	* include/client.h (SNO_DEFAULT): don't set SNO_DEBUG by default;
	seemed like a good idea at the time...

	* doc/example.conf: document new F lines

2000-11-29  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_debug.c: rewrite debug_init() and vdebug() in terms of
	new logging functions, which have special support for the debug
	log; added loop detection to vdebug(), so that I can
	sendto_opmask_butone() from log_vwrite() without incurring another
	call to vdebug()

	* ircd/s_conf.c (rehash): call log_reopen() from rehash routine;
	this allows log file rotations

	* ircd/m_kill.c: call log_write_kill() instead of ircd_log_kill()

	* ircd/ircd_log.c: much more work fleshing out the interface;
	removed old interface; included backwards-compat ircd_log()
	function that logs to subsystem LS_OLDLOG

	* ircd/ircd.c: switch to new log_init()/log_close()/log_reopen()
	functions

	* include/ircd_log.h: include stdarg.h for va_list; move ordering
	warning to top of file; fill out LogSys enum; declare new
	log_debug_init(), log_vwrite(), log_write_kill(), and
	log_[sg]et_*() functions; add flags argument to log_write();
	defined flags to inhibit various logging actions

	* include/client.h: added support for new SNO_DEBUG, enabled only
	if DEBUGMODE is defined

2000-11-28  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/ircd_log.c: make sure the various LOG_* constants are
	defined (probably not needed, since #include <syslog.h> isn't
	conditional); various static data needed for the new logging
	functions; definitions of new logging functions

	* include/ircd_log.h: new LogSys enum, declarations for part of
	new logging API

	* ircd/motd.c: we were setting type to MOTD_CLASS unconditionally,
	which was of course stupid; switched to using switch/case in
	initialization in motd_create(); zero the MotdList.other pointer
	from motd_clear()

	* ircd/ircd.c (main): motd_init() has to come before init_conf(),
	or we overwrite init_conf()'s hard work with respect to T-lines

2000-11-27  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_stats.c: comment out report_motd_list and include a
	reference to motd_report()

	* ircd/s_conf.c: rip out the old MOTD manipulation functions; call
	motd_add() from the conf parser; call motd_clear() from the rehash
	routine; remove the no longer needed memory clearing and reloading
	stuff from the rehash service routine

	* ircd/motd.c: loads new API, including static internal functions
	to do allocation/deallocation, etc.

	* ircd/m_stats.c: use new motd_report() instead of
	report_motd_list()

	* ircd/m_motd.c: use new syntax for motd_send()

	* ircd/ircd.c: use new motd_init() function

	* ircd/Makefile.in (SRC): forgot to add motd.c to SRC in
	Makefile.(in); also ran make depend

	* include/motd.h: don't need config.h, but now do need time.h;
	define new structures and constants; redefine old API and define
	new functions

2000-11-22  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_user.c (register_user): use motd_signon() instead of
	calling m_motd; much cleaner this way

	* ircd/motd.c: write the new motd_* stuff to make MOTD handling
	less of a crock

	* ircd/m_motd.c: rewrite m{,s}_motd to call out to new motd_*
	functions

	* include/motd.h: define new MOTD API stuff

2000-11-20  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/ircd_reply.c (protocol_violation): rewrite
	protocol_violation so it'll actually work

	oh, yeah, use %s -> cptr->name, instead of %c -> cptr, so we get
	the client's real name in there.

	* ircd/m_motd.c (m_motd): Iso's addition of get_client_class(sptr)
	resulted in core dumps if NODEFAULTMOTD is defined, because m_motd
	gets called from register_user with a NULL sptr.  This is probably
	a design problem, but this bandaid will do for now...

2000-11-19  Isomer <isomer@coders.net>
	* ircd/ircd_reply.c: added 'protocol_violation', thus alerting us
	to problems in the server<->server protocol.

	* ircd/m_connect.c: allow remote connects with a port of '0'
	meaning to use the port in the config file.

	* ircd/m_create.c: Enable hacking protection, lets see how far we
	get.

	* ircd/m_error.c: The RFC says never accept ERROR from unreg'd
	clients, so we don't any more.

	* ircd/m_kill.c: The kill path is now made up of numnicks of servers,
	and the user@host is displayed of the victim.

	* ircd/m_map.c: reloaded 'dump_map'.

	* ircd/m_trace.c: allow per class T:

	* ircd/m_stats.c: allow local opers /remote stats anywhere on the 'net.

2000-11-17  Isomer <isomer@coders.net>

	* ircd/m_topic.c: Fixed bug where we'd only send to clients topics
	that were the *same* instead of different.  Oh the embarrasment!

	* ircd/IPcheck.c: Merged net's fix.

2000-11-02  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/m_whois.c: remove compiler warning by adding a newline to
	end of file

	* ircd/m_names.c: moved the flags up to s_user.h

	* ircd/m_join.c: call do_names instead of m_names; restructure
	ms_join to never transmute a JOIN into a CREATE, but use the TS in
	the JOIN (if present) to timestamp the channel

	* ircd/channel.c: send JOINs individually, instead of grouping
	them, so that we can send the channel's creation time

	* include/s_user.h: declare do_names()

2000-10-30  Isomer <isomer@coders.net>
	* ircd/m_oper.c: Fixed warning

2000-10-30  Isomer <isomer@coders.net>
	* ircd/m_oper.c: Fixed over agressive cut and no paste

2000-10-30  Isomer <isomer@coders.net>

	* ircd/m_topic.c: Restructured, fixed bug where topics on local
	channels are propergated (I forget who pointed this out to me, but
	thanks anyway).  Also to save bandwidth don't send the topic to
	users if the topic is already the same on the server (but still
	propergate to other servers).  X/W's "autotopic" feature must
	chew a lot of bandwidth, hopefully this will help reduce this.

	* doc/rfc1459.rfc: Updated documentation on /topic.

	* ircd/listener.c: snotice warnings about failed accept()'s
	potentially warning admins that they're running out of fd's.

	* ircd/stats.c, ircd/class.c: Removed /stats v, added number of
	people in a class in /stats y

	* ircd/m_create.c: Checks for timewarp hacking and squit's
	evil servers. (currently disabled)
	

2000-10-30  net <simms@lucida.qc.ca>
	
	* ircd/gline.c: Fixed various bugs Isomer left behind.

2000-10-26  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/m_join.c (m_join): reply on attempt to join a BADCHANed
	channel is now ERR_BANNEDFROMCHAN instead of ERR_BADCHANNAME

2000-10-24  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/channel.c: ok, now last mode rules; mode +ps will always
	result in +s (and won't send a mode if the channel is already +s);
	mode +sp will always result in +p; -n+n on a +n channel results in
	no mode change; -n+n on a -n channel results in a +n mode change;
	etc.

2000-10-23  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/channel.c: add "add" and "del" elements to ParseState to
	avoid not-too-pretty -p+s when +s is sufficient; fix a bug in
	mode_parse_limit that caused it to clear all channel modes
	prematurely; restructure mode_parse_mode to avoid calling
	modebuf_mode too early (ties in with first mentioned change);
	better logic for +p/+s mutual exclusivity; initialize "add" and
	"del" elements in mode_parse; send simple modes down to
	modebuf_mode after the loop in mode_parse

2000-09-28  Greg Sikorski <gte@atomicrevs.demon.co.uk>
	* ircd/m_names.c: Fixed a non-lethal logic error that 
	triggers an assert() in find_member_link while debugging.
	(Spotted by Maniac-).
2000-09-19  Thomas Helvey <helveytw@home.com>
	* ircd/s_conf.c: move K:lines to their own list and data
	structures, add supporting code.

	merge conflicts.
	* ircd/*.h: merged in changes from 2.10.10.pl12, cleanup
	merge conflicts

2000-09-16  Thomas Helvey <helveytw@home.com>
	* ircd/s_conf.c: add code for server struct
	* ircd/client.c: copy of class.c sort of, new file for client
	specific operations, will move things here as appropriate,
	currently only one function is exported from here.
	* ircd/*.c: general logic cleanups, convert negatives to
	positives in places.

2000-09-16  Thomas Helvey <helveytw@home.com>
	* ircd/s_conf.c: add code for new crule data structs, strip quotes
	* ircd/crule.c: clean up scary casting a bit, type safety stuff
	* include/s_conf.h: add CRuleConf struct and support, remove
	unused constants
	* include/crule.h: type safety cleanups
	* ircd/*.c: fixup code that depended on stuff I changed

2000-09-15  Thomas Helvey <helveytw@home.com>
	* ircd/s_conf.c: start adding code for new conf data structs, changed
	listeners, admin line, motd lines, class lines. Move validate_hostent
	to resolver. General mayhem.

2000-09-13  Thomas Helvey <helveytw@home.com>
	* ircd/list.c: put Clients in free lists, pre-allocate MAXCONNECTIONS
	local clients.
	* ircd/list.c: put SLinks in free lists
	* ircd/channel.c: put Memberships in free lists
	* ircd/ircd.c: rearrange initializations a bit in main
	Note: With these changes, ircd NEVER frees Clients, SLinks or
	Memberships. It will also rarely need to allocate new
	ones during net bursts and other disruptions. This should
	cut down on memory fragmentation a bit as well.

2000-08-30  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/m_names.c (do_names): pull-up from do_names fix in
	u2.10.10.pl11

2000-07-15  Perry Lorier       <Isomer@coders.net>
	* various: IP only k:'s and G:'s now do bit tests instead of two(!) 
                 match()'s.  Major Major cpu savings.  Also speed up the
                 other case slightly.  As a side effect you can now
		 k/Gline *@10.0.0.0/8.  I'll do bans tomorrow, it's nearing
		 3am.

	* ircd/m_names.c: Clean up compiler warnings.

2000-06-09  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/channel.c (mode_parse_client): don't send warning if
	there's not enough arguments for a +/-o/v; means the habit of
	doing "/mode #channel +oooooo bob" doesn't result in a bunch of
	error messages

2000-06-04  Greg Sikorski <gte@atomicrevs.demon.co.uk>

	* ircd/m_names.c: Re-factor code to remove unneccessary
	GlobalChannelList iteration every time someone joins a channel.

2000-06-02  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_user.c: add struct Gline * argument to register_user;
	look up global glines and repropagate them if necessary; send
	acknowledgement of gline to remote servers when registering users

	* ircd/s_serv.c (server_estab): don't send acknowledgement of
	local glines to remote servers; do send gline acknowledgement of
	bursted users

	* ircd/m_user.c (m_user): pass new struct Gline * argument to
	register_user

	* ircd/m_pong.c: pass new struct Gline * argument to register_user

	* ircd/m_nick.c (ms_nick): document protocol change

	* ircd/gline.c: support GLINE_LASTMOD

	* include/s_user.h: add struct Gline * argument to register_user

	* include/gline.h: add GLINE_LASTMOD to look up non-zero lastmods

	* ircd/s_conf.c (find_kill): add unsigned int argument to
	gline_lookup()

	* ircd/gline.c: add GLINE_GLOBAL to lookup or find only global
	glines; add unsigned int argument to gline_lookup()

	* include/gline.h: add GLINE_GLOBAL flag; add unsigned int
	argument to gline_lookup()

	* ircd/m_server.c: Resend jupe only when there is no %<lastmod>
	parameter, or when it falls out of bounds: see comments prior to
	call to jupe_resend(); call server_estab with struct Jupe
	parameter, so that we place the appropriate %<lastmod> in the
	appropriate place.

	* ircd/s_serv.c (server_estab): send %<lastmod> for introduced
	server, as well as for servers when we're sending the BURST

	* include/s_serv.h: add a struct Jupe * to the arguments for
	server_estab() so that we can send the appropriate lastmod
	parameter

	* ircd/m_gline.c (ms_gline): actually, this should be the
	slightest bit more efficient...

	* ircd/m_jupe.c (ms_jupe): actually, this should be the slightest
	bit more efficient...

	* ircd/m_gline.c (ms_gline): inhibit GLINE processing resends
	during netburst

	* ircd/m_jupe.c (ms_jupe): inhibit JUPE processing resends during
	netburst

	* ircd/channel.c (joinbuf_join): really remove user from local
	channels

2000-05-29  Perry Lorier       <Isomer@coders.net>
	* ircd/m_names.c: Removed redundant space. 
	* ircd/s_bsd.c: Fixed incorrect syntax on ERROR line.

2000-05-18  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/m_burst.c (ms_burst): er...that should have been a ",", not
	a " "

2000-05-04  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/channel.c: replace bogus assertions with returns, which is
	logically correct; only wipe out limit/key if they were originally
	set in the first place; remove user from channel when doing a
	PARTALL; only send MODE +o for user CREATEing channel if user is
	not MyUser--CREATE will only be used if the channel did not
	originally exist, therefore we can assume no one local is on the
	channel anyway, and we don't exactly need for the user to see an
	explicit +o for themselves

	* doc/readme.gline: describe the syntax of the GLINE command

	* doc/readme.jupe: update to reflect a couple of changes to JUPE

	* ircd/gline.c: don't propagate local changes

	* ircd/jupe.c: don't propagate local changes

	* ircd/m_gline.c (mo_gline): force local flag when deactivating
	glines with 0 lastmod

	* ircd/gline.c (gline_deactivate): G-lines with zero lastmod time
	are now removed instead of being deactivated

	* ircd/m_gline.c (ms_gline): make G-lines of the form "GLINE *
	-<mask>" be accepted

	* ircd/channel.c (send_channel_modes): deal with one of the last
	vestiges of sendbuf

	* ircd/m_burst.c (ms_burst): debugged ban processing; removed
	debugging hooks

	* ircd/channel.c (modebuf_extract): remove debugging
	sendto_opmask_butone calls

2000-05-03  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/channel.c: support a couple of new flags to support using
	mode_parse; fix some bugs with 0 struct ModeBuf *; implementation
	of modebuf_extract to extract added flags for use by ms_burst

	* include/channel.h: a couple of new flags to support using
	mode_parse inside ms_burst

	* ircd/m_burst.c (ms_burst): brand new implementation of BURST

	* ircd/m_endburst.c: add loop to processing of end_of_burst to
	free empty channels after the BURST is over.

	* ircd/m_server.c: convert to use new send.c functions--I wanted
	to rewrite it from scratch, but the logic's pretty complex; I may
	still rewrite it, though...

2000-05-02  Thomas Helvey <tomh@inxpress.net>

	* ircd/ircd.c: fix broken header include ordering

2000-05-02  Thomas Helvey <tomh@inxpress.net>
	
	* ircd/IPcheck.c: cleanups for ZenShadow's cleanups
        review emailed privately

	* include/IPcheck.h: removed unneeded include

2000-05-02  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/s_user.c (hunt_server): throw in a comment so I know what
	the sendto_one is for

	* include/querycmds.h (Count_unknownbecomesclient): convert to
	sendto_opmask_butone

	* ircd/send.c: start removing dead code

	* include/send.h: start removing dead code

	* ircd/m_rping.c: convert to sendcmdto_one / send_reply /
	hunt_server_cmd

	* ircd/m_rpong.c: convert to sendcmdto_one / send_reply

2000-05-01  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/m_stats.c: convert to sendcmdto_one / send_reply

	* ircd/m_kick.c: Completely reimplement m_kick

	* ircd/channel.c: send_user_joins removed; it was dead code,
	anyway...

2000-05-01  Perry Lorier <isomer@coders.net>
	* ircd/m_invite.c: Fix for the rest of m_invite.c, and again.
	* ircd/channels.c: My fix for the part problem.  Untested, probably
		won't work.  Can't be much worse than the current problem.
		it'll either work or core, take your pick.


2000-04-30  Perry Lorier <isomer@coders.net>
	* config/config-sh.in: Fix for CONNEXIT
	* ircd/s_{user,misc}.c: Fix for CONNEXIT
	* ircd/m_invite.c: Fix for incorrectly numnickified invite.
			(Kev: Want to come talk to me about this?)

2000-04-30  Steven M. Doyle <steven@doyle.net>
 	* ircd/ircd.c
 	  - general cleanups and readability enhancements
 	  - rewrite of setuid/chroot code.
 	  - server will no longer run as root
 	  - -DPROFIL compile option removed
	  - Fixed IPcheck API calls
 
 	* config/config-sh.in
 	  - Fixed up chroot compile options
 	  - Added options for debug and profile compiles
 
 	* config/gen.ircd.Makefile

	* ircd/IPcheck.c
	  - Readability cleanups (well, I -think-...)
	  - Changed IPRegistryEntry.last_connect to a time_t.  The previously
	    used unsigned short was probably causing interesting things after
	    a client had been connected longer than about 65,535 seconds...
	  - Removed old API functions.

	* ircd/whocmds.c
	  - Removed IPcheck.h include

	joinbuf_flush

	* include/channel.h: definitions and declarations for the struct
	JoinBuf abstraction

2000-04-29  Perry Lorier <isomer@coders.net>
	* ircd/s_bsd.c: Ok, so I thought I compiled and tested this...

2000-04-29  Perry Lorier <isomer@coders.net>
	* ircd/s_bsd.c: Add debugging code to IPcheck

	* ircd/s_numeric.c (do_numeric): use new sendcmdto_* functions,
	kinda hackish...

	* ircd/parse.c (parse_server): argument wrangling to make
	processing in do_numeric a little easier to deal with

	* ircd/s_serv.c (server_estab): SERVER should come from
	acptr->serv->up, not &me

	* ircd/m_admin.c: convert to send_reply and hunt_server_cmd

	* ircd/s_user.c (hunt_server_cmd): new hunt_server replacement
	that takes cmd and tok arguments, etc.  NOTE: THIS IMPLEMENTATION
	HAS A MAJOR HACK!!!  The whole hunt_server architecture should be
	carefully rethought...

	* ircd/s_stats.c (hunt_stats): use new hunt_server_cmd

	* include/s_user.h: hunt_server_cmd -- replacement for hunt_server

	* ircd/s_misc.c: *sigh* 2.10.10 doesn't support squitting by
	numeric nick; therefore, we have to use the server name

	* ircd/m_squit.c (ms_squit): allow to squit by server numeric nick

	* ircd/send.c: fix minor bugs

	* ircd/s_user.c (check_target_limit): mark dead code so I filter
	it when I grep

	* ircd/s_serv.c (exit_new_server): mark dead code so I filter it
	when I grep

	* ircd/parse.c: mark dead code so I filter it when I grep

	functions

	* ircd/channel.c: mark dead code so I filter it when I grep

	* ircd/s_stats.c: use send_reply instead of sendto_one w/rpl_str;
	hope I'm not stepping on toes...

	* ircd/s_conf.c: more sendto_opmask_butone / send_reply
	conversions; use ircd_snprintf in a couple of cases to negate the
	possibility of buffer overflow

2000-04-26  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/channel.c: convert as much as possible to new send
	semantics

	* ircd/send.c (sendcmdto_common_channels): fix a subtle bug --
	test member->user->from->fd, not from->fd

	* ircd/gline.c (gline_add): go ahead and add badchans; we just
	won't look for them in m_gline; this way, they always work...

	* ircd/jupe.c: use ircd_vsnprintf conversion specifiers

	* ircd/gline.c: since write_log now uses ircd_vsnprintf, use
	ircd_vsnprintf conversion specifiers

	* ircd/support.c (write_log): use ircd_vsnprintf for write_log, so
	I have my conversion specifiers

	* ircd/gline.c (do_gline): use send_reply for ERR_YOUREBANNEDCREEP

	* ircd/send.c (sendcmdto_flag_butone): explicitly send WALLOPS to
	local users

	* ircd/s_serv.c (exit_new_server): rewrite exit_new_server to be a
	little less brain-dead

	* ircd/s_misc.c: use sendcmdto_one, sendrawto_one, and send_reply

	* ircd/s_debug.c: use send_reply with RPL_EXPLICIT for
	RPL_STATSDEBUG

	* ircd/res.c (cres_mem): use send_reply with RPL_EXPLICIT for
	RPL_STATSDEBUG

	* ircd/list.c (send_listinfo): use send_reply with RPL_EXPLICIT
	for RPL_STATSDEBUG

	ERR_INVALIDUSERNAME

	* ircd/ircd_reply.c (send_reply): support RPL_EXPLICIT

	* include/ircd_reply.h (RPL_EXPLICIT): somewhat of a hack to mark
	a numeric as needing to use an explicit pattern, which will be the
	first argument in the variable argument list

	* ircd/s_user.c: use sendrawto_one instead of sendto_one to send
	non-prefixed nospoof PING

	* ircd/s_bsd.c: use sendrawto_one instead of sendto_one to send
	non-prefixed SERVER login

	* ircd/ircd.c (check_pings): fix last sendto_one calls (except for
	a numeric usage further up)

	* include/send.h: declare sendrawto_one

	* ircd/send.c (sendrawto_one): new function to use ONLY for
	non-prefixed commands, like PING to client, or PASS/SERVER on
	server registration

2000-04-25  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/ircd_snprintf.c (doprintf): implement %H for possible
	future expansion (channel numerics?)

	* include/ircd_snprintf.h: added documentation to # to explain use
	with %C; added documentation for : to explain use with %C; added
	documentation for %H for channels

	* ircd/whocmds.c: use send_reply

	* ircd/userload.c: use sendcmdto_one

	* ircd/uping.c: use sendcmdto_one

	* ircd/send.c: use new flags to %C format string; ':' prefixes
	client name with a colon for local connects, '#' uses
	nick!user@host form for local connects

	* ircd/s_user.c: use send_reply, sendto_opmask_butone,
	sendcmdto_one, sendcmdto_serv_butone, sendcmdto_flag_butone

	* ircd/ircd_snprintf.c (doprintf): minor bug fixes and some
	debugging assertions

2000-04-24  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/support.c: dumpcore is no longer used, so get rid of it

	* ircd/parse.c: use send_reply, sendcmdto_one

	* ircd/map.c: use send_reply

	* ircd/listener.c: use send_reply

	* ircd/jupe.c: use sendto_opmask_butone, send_reply

	* ircd/ircd_reply.c: use send_reply

	* ircd/ircd.c: use sendto_opmask_butone

	* ircd/gline.c: use sendto_opmask_butone, send_reply

	* ircd/ircd_snprintf.c (doprintf): make it deal with incompletely
	registered clients; make FLAG_ALT print nick!user@host; make
	FLAG_COLON print :blah

	* ircd/class.c (report_classes): use send_reply instead of
	sendto_one

	* ircd/hash.c (m_hash): replace sendto_one with sendcmdto_one

	* ircd/IPcheck.c (ip_registry_connect_succeeded): replace
	sendto_one with sendcmdto_one

2000-04-21  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/send.c: clean up logic in sendcmdto_channel_butone; use
	MyConnect() instead of IsServer() in sendcmdto_flag_butone; define
	sendcmdto_match_butone

	* include/send.h: declare sendcmdto_match_butone

2000-04-20  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/jupe.c: update to use send_reply()

	* ircd/gline.c: update to use send_reply()

	* include/ircd_reply.h: declare send_reply

	* ircd/ircd_reply.c (send_reply): send_error_to_client, but for
	replies; uses ircd_snprintf

	* ircd/send.c: added comments to redirect searchers to appropriate
	sendcmdto_* function; moved new functions to end of file; added
	explanatory comments; reordered arguments; defined new functions
	mentioned below

	* ircd/m_jupe.c: reorder arguments to sendcmdto_* functions

	* ircd/m_gline.c: reorder arguments to sendcmdto_* functions

	* ircd/jupe.c: reorder arguments to sendcmdto_* functions

	* ircd/gline.c: reorder arguments to sendcmdto_* functions

	* include/send.h: reorder arguments, add explanatory comments,
	declare new functions sendcmdto_flag_butone, sendto_opmask_butone,
	and vsendto_opmask_butone

2000-04-19  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/send.c: define sendcmdto_channel_butone, wrote a simplified
	vsendto_op_mask that uses '*' instead of the receiving client
	nickname

	* include/send.h: declare sendcmdto_channel_butone; takes a skip
	argument that allows you to skip (or not to skip) deaf users,
	users behind bursting servers, and non channel operators

2000-04-17  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/send.c: new sendcmdto_channel_butserv -- note that old
	sendto_channel_butserv has a subtle bug; also wrote
	sendcmdto_common_channels.

	* include/send.h: declare new sendcmdto_* functions

	* ircd/jupe.c: support local deactivations of jupes

	* ircd/gline.c: support local deactivations of glines

	* include/jupe.h: JUPE_LDEACT allows jupes to be locally
	deactivated; if they aren't locally deactivated, then it slaves to
	the net-wide activation status; JupeIsRemActive() tests only
	whether the jupe is active everywhere else

	* include/gline.h: GLINE_LDEACT allows glines to be locally
	deactivated; if they aren't locally deactivated, then it slaves to
	the net-wide activation status; GlineIsRemActive() tests only
	whether the gline is active everywhere else

	* ircd/gline.c: detect overlapping G-lines; if an existing, wider
	gline expires after the new one will, we drop the new one,
	otherwise we add the G-line after that one (so the wide one will
	apply first); if the new one contains an existing G-line and if it
	will expire after the existing one, we drop the existing one to
	save memory

	* ircd/m_gline.c (mo_gline): opers could issue remote local
	glines when CONFIG_OPERCMDS was off; fixed

2000-04-16  Kevin L. Mitchell  <klmitch@mit.edu>

	* ircd/m_jupe.c (mo_jupe): allow target argument to be dropped if
	this is a local JUPE

	* ircd/gline.c: add flags argument to gline_activate and
	gline_deactivate for future expansion

	* ircd/m_gline.c: pass flags to gline_activate and
	gline_deactivate

	* include/gline.h: add flags argument to gline_activate and
	gline_deactivate

	* ircd/jupe.c: add flags argument to jupe_activate and
	jupe_deactivate for future expansion

	* include/jupe.h: add flags argument to jupe_activate and

	* ircd/gline.c: make gline expire times relative to CurrentTime,
	since that should be monotonically increasing, instead of
	TStime(), which can be set backwards, and which can therefore
	cause an expire time to increase; make local glines be removed
	instead of just deactivated; don't let gline_find() look for
	user@host glines if the mask being looked up is a channel mask

	* ircd/send.c (vsendcmdto_one): forgot to account for the case
	where origin is a server and destination is a user

	* ircd/jupe.c: make jupe expire times relative to CurrentTime,
	since that should be monotonically increasing, instead of
	TStime(), which can be set backwards, and which can therefore
	cause an expire time to increase; make local jupes be removed
	instead of just deactivated

	* ircd/ircd_snprintf.c: d'oh, thanks for catching that; short for

	* ircd/gline.c: modify to utilize new sendcmdto_* series of
	functions; also fix gline_lookup() to deal properly with remote

	up!

	* ircd/ircd_snprintf.c (doprintf): a dest of &me is a server,
	too...

	* ircd/send.c: wrote sendcmdto_one(), vsendcmdto_one(), and

	CONFIG_OPERCMDS is enabled

	* ircd/m_jupe.c (mo_jupe): don't compile mo_jupe() if

	* ircd/m_join.c: look up badchans with GLINE_EXACT

	* ircd/m_gline.c: fix parc count problems; look up existing
	G-lines with GLINE_EXACT; only set new lastmod when

	propagate a gline with 0 lastmod if origin is user; add
	GLINE_EXACT to force exact matching of gline mask

	* ircd/ircd_snprintf.c (doprintf): forgot to deal with the zero
	flag properly

	* ircd/s_conf.c (find_kill): gline_find() takes a char *userhost,

	MODEBUF_DEST_OPMODE flag

	* ircd/channel.c (modebuf_flush): added new flag,
	MODEBUF_DEST_OPMODE; causes channel MODE/HACK(4) notice to appear
	to originate from source's server (or source itself, if
	IsServer(source)); also causes a server-level MODE to be sent as
	OPMODE instead
