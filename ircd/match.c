 * Subject: [C-Com] Analysis for `mmatch' (was: gline4 problem)
 * To: coder-com@mail.undernet.org (coder committee)
 * Date: Mon, 2 Sep 1996 12:26:01 +0200 (MET DST)
 *
 * We need a new function `mmatch(const char *old_mask, const char *new_mask)'
 * which returns `true' likewise the current `match' (start with copying it),
 * but which treats '*' and '?' in `new_mask' differently (not "\*" and "\?" !)
 * as follows:  a '*' in `new_mask' does not match a '?' in `old_mask' and
 * a '?' in `new_mask' does not match a '\?' in `old_mask'.
 * And ofcourse... a '*' in `new_mask' does not match a '\*' in `old_mask'...
 * And last but not least, '\?' and '\*' in `new_mask' now become one character.
 */

/** Compares one mask against another.
 * One wildcard mask may be said to be a superset of another if the
 * set of strings matched by the first is a proper superset of the set
 * of strings matched by the second.  In practical terms, this means
 * that the second is made redundant by the first.
 *
 * The logic for this test is similar to that in match(), but a
 * backslash in old_mask only matches a backslash in new_mask (and
 * requires the next character to match exactly), and -- after
 * contiguous runs of wildcards are logically collapsed -- a '?' in
 * old_mask does not match a '*' in new_mask.
 *
 * @param[in] old_mask One wildcard mask.
 * @param[in] new_mask Another wildcard mask.
 * @return Zero if \a old_mask is a superset of \a new_mask, non-zero otherwise.

 ***************** Nemesi's matchcomp() / matchexec() **************
 */

/** @page compiledmasks Compiled Masks
 * These functions allow the use of "compiled" masks, you compile a mask
 * by means of matchcomp() that gets the plain text mask as input and writes
 * its result in the memory locations addressed by the 3 parameters:
 * - *cmask will contain the text of the compiled mask
 * - *minlen will contain the length of the shortest string that can match 
 *   the mask
 * - *charset will contain the minimal set of chars needed to match the mask
 * You can pass NULL as *charset and it will be simply not returned, but you
 * MUST pass valid pointers for *minlen and *cmask (which must be big enough 
 * to contain the compiled mask text that is in the worst case as long as the 
 * text of the mask itself in plaintext format) and the return value of 
 * matchcomp() will be the number of chars actually written there (excluded 
 * the trailing zero). cmask can be == mask, matchcomp() can work in place.
 * The {cmask, minlen} couple of values make the real compiled mask and
 * need to be passed to the functions that use the compiled mask, if you pass
 * the wrong minlen or something wrong in cmask to one of these expect a
 * coredump. This means that when you record a compiled mask you must store
 * *both* these values.
 * Once compiled the mask can be used to match a string by means of 
 * matchexec(), it can be printed back to human-readable format by means
 * of sprintmatch() or it can be compared to another compiled mask by means
 * of mmexec() that will tell if it completely overrides that mask (a lot like
 * what mmatch() does for plain text masks).
 * You can gain a lot of speed in many situations avoiding to matchexec() when:
 * - The maximum length of the field you are about to match() the mask to is
 *   shorter than minlen, in example when matching abc*def*ghil with a nick:
 *   It just cannot match since a nick is at most 9 chars long and the mask
 *   needs at least 10 chars (10 will be the value returned in minlen).
 * - The charset allowed for the field you are about to match to doesn't
 *   "contain" the charset returned by matchcomp(), in example when you
 *   have *.* as mask it makes no sense to try to match it against a nick
 *   because, again, a nick can't contain a '.', you can check this with
 *   a simple (charset & NTL_IRCNK) in this case.
 * - As a special case, since compiled masks are forced to lowercase,
 *   it would make no sense to use the NTL_LOWER and NTL_UPPER on a compiled
 *   mask, thus they are reused as follows: if the NTL_LOWER bit of charset
 *   is set it means that the mask contains only non-wilds chars (i.e. you can
 *   use strCasecmp() to match it or a direct hash lookup), if the NTL_UPPER
 *   bit is set it means that it contains only wild chars (and you can
 *   match it with strlen(field)>=minlen).
 * Do these optimizations ONLY when the data you are about to pass to
 * matchexec() are *known* to be invalid in advance, using strChattr() 
 * or strlen() on the text would be slower than calling matchexec() directly
 * and let it fail.
 * Internally a compiled mask contain in the *cmask area the text of
 * the plain text form of the mask itself with applied the following hacks:
 * - All characters are forced to lowercase (so that uppercase letters and
 *   specifically the symbols 'A' and 'Z' are reserved for special use)
 * - All non-escaped stars '*' are replaced by the letter 'Z'
 * - All non-escaped question marks '?' are replaced by the letter 'A' 
 * - All escape characters are removed, the wilds escaped by them are
 *   then passed by without the escape since they don't collide anymore
 *   with the real wilds (encoded as A/Z) 
 * - Finally the part of the mask that follows the last asterisk is
 *   reversed (byte order mirroring) and moved right after the first
 *   asterisk.
 * After all this a mask like:   Head*CHUNK1*chu\*nK2*ch??k3*TaIl 
 *               .... becomes:   headZliatZchunk1Zchu*nk2ZchAAk3
 * This can still be printed on a console, more or less understood by an
 * human and handled with the usual str*() library functions.
 * When you store somewhere the compiled mask you can avoid storing the
 * textform of it since it can be "decompiled" by means of sprintmatch(),
 * but at that time the following things are changed in the mask:
 * - All chars have been forced to lowercase.
 * - The mask is collapsed.
 * The balance point of using compiled masks in terms of CPU is when you expect
 * to use matchexec() instead of match() at least 20 times on the same mask
 * or when you expect to use mmexec() instead of mmatch() 3 times.
